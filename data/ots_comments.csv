community,"Thank you for this opportunity. In my opinion, I would encourage our students(undergrad/graduate/MBAs/MDs/JDs) to work together via collaboration and projects to break down the barrier among disciplinary. The living-learning experience among diverse students will make UVA brand competitive and unique. My proposal is to put diverse students together for hands-on learning projects on grounds. the UVA Graduate Consulting Club and Data Science and Analytics Club are aimed to bridge the gap among students, and apply what they learned in a classroom to meet UVA's needs (i.e., optimize UVA Energy efficiency to meet 2025 carbon footprint, and cherish green and sustainable campus, etc.)",Student,Zhongwen
community,"UVA's new president is excluding much of the University community with his excessive focus on running.

community,"“The community” comes into UVA every day--as faculty, staff, students, and patients. The community staffs and maintains the University. UVA is the product of the local community. The community IS here.  But more of the community should be here. The enormous holdings of the UVA libraries are available to any citizen of the Commonwealth, exhibitions drawn from the rich collections of the Small Library and the Fralin should be go-to opportunities for community members, as should the wealth of o...n-grounds music, dance, and drama events. Community news outlets like the Daily Progress, Cville, and WVIR could be more energetically and creatively used to publicize UVA offerings and events. But UVA’s lack of short-term parking for access to these resources is a deterrent to members of the community coming to UVA with their family and friends for an event—or from coming here at all.  That is especially true for retirees (a rapidly growing proportion of the local population) and for people with children.   

The UVA community itself would benefit from (and probably appreciate) seeing “ordinary” UVA faculty and staff members featured on the front end of the UVA website in addition to the award winners, innovators, and news pieces that at present populate that high profile space.

community,"At this point in time, it is near common knowledge that the threat of climate change is both impending and large-scale for the global community of today and tomorrow. Perhaps more troublesome is the threat of climate inaction. As an academic community part of larger more global network of beings finding a home on Earth, I believe this university must finally meditate, and more importantly enact upon the question of what our role should be in the fight to limit global warming. 

	This question...is daunting, and it is clouded by a lot of skepticism. Let us think back to an earlier global goal: putting a man on the moon. The prospect of success seemed slim, often times the task seemed impossible, but we did it with our technologies and determination. The scientific community has developed astonishing technologies and provided us with sound and factual methods of confronting the issue of climate change. Right now, we are lacking a passionate conglomeration of individuals willing to address the new climate standards necessary to reduce the potential consequences of global warming. U.Va must be one these individuals.

	If we carry on with business as usual, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says we are headed towards a world nearly 4°C warmer than today; a world sure to be defined by catastrophic consequences. The goal of the Paris Agreement was to limit warming to merely 2°C to avoid some of the most dire results of climate inaction, but why not resolve to do better than that? Climate change will affect global communities in a vast array of quite frankly very unfair ways. If I understand the mission of this university community, we are here to better ourselves for the communities we are both a part of and have never been to. Every single one of us has a stake in climate change, this has always been and will always be U.Va’s fight.

	To be headed in the right track, by the year 2050 the IPCC reports that globally 50-60% of electricity must come from renewable energy sources; currently the United States is at 22%. 35-65% of transportation must be generated by renewable sources, and 55-75% of all building energy must be electric, and these are feasible targets for our university community. Beyond this, we have faculty and passionate students willing to research and better land-use options. For example, forest expansion efforts would draw carbon out of the atmosphere, and better agricultural practices can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses and methane in the atmosphere. Even more interestingly, the future of this planet relies on the development of nuclear energy resources, an area of research our very own university could seek to investigate more about.

	It is not all about money. It is about doing our part as individuals and as a community for the sake of humanity. President Ryan I encourage you to listen to student groups and faculty advocating for more sustainable options here on grounds; from no straws in the PAV, to the complex climate graphs that take some explanation to understand. After all, we must do our part.

community,"My name is Gabrielle DelBiondo and I am currently a first year. I’m writing you this letter to voice my concern about the growing climate change problem and how little UVA is doing to reduce our emissions. Currently, the average global temperature has increased by about one degree Celsius. This may not seem significant, but one degree of warming can lead to catastrophic damage, such as an increase in the number of deadly heat days. The IPCC estimates that by 2050 if nothing is done to reduce e...missions and prevent further warming, the number of deadly heat days in Charlottesville will increase to thirty-nine. This is extremely alarming, especially because UVA’s large campus means that students must walk around in this fatal heat. To avoid this, action must be taken to reduce emissions and limit warming to only 1.5 degrees Celsius.
As one of the top public universities in the nation, UVA should be a leader in sustainability. To do so, we should be striving toward energy efficiency. This could mean simply switching all of the lightbulbs to LED or, even better, making more of the buildings run off of solar. Dining facilities use some of the most energy out of all of the buildings at UVA. Last week, O’Hill Dining Hall used an average of about 5300 kWh of electricity per day and Newcomb Hall peaked at about 9800 kWh. By switching to more energy efficient products, we can lower the amount of energy being used in this building, thus lower the emissions UVA produced. I understand that these changes might be expensive, but acting now will help us avoid future risks.
Additionally, we should strive to eliminate as much waste as possible. The dining facilities produce a large food waste and trash from the paper to-go boxes. The white boxes are compostable, but we should be making more efforts to encourage people to use the more sustainable reusable boxes. To further reduce emissions in the dining facilities, we should limit the amount of red meat that is served. By doing so, it will help to cut down on methane, a greenhouse gas that is twenty times more potent than carbon dioxide. These are small actions but can have a great influence and cost very little. We should start by informing students at UVA about the importance of recycling, avoiding food waste, and eating more plants/less meat. 
Climate change is a major problem that causes many people cognitive dissonance. By acknowledging that global warming is real and happening, it creates a sense of responsibility to take action. If UVA decides to address these issues, it will put our school at the forefront of sustainability other colleges will follow our path. UVA is ours to shape, so let us be the leader on this vast global issue.

community,"My name is Glen Walker and I am currently a third year here at UVA. Not only that, but I am also a local here in Charlottesville, so looking towards our future is something that I consider a very personal matter. Firstly, I would like to thank you for giving students the opportunity to reach out about the change they think is necessary on our grounds. Secondly, I would like to propose some changes myself that I believe our community needs and deserves. 

Being such a progressive school, the en...vironment and climate change are topics that many students here are passionate about, myself being one of them. The urgency of global warming is a sensitive subject given our current political climate, but one that cannot be pushed aside. We are determining the future of our planet every day and as time passes, it becomes more and more critical that every opportunity is taken to protect the Earth. 

There are many ways, both big and small, in which the University can make changes to better the outcome of climate change. Implementing small changes, such as making sure efficiency light bulbs are used and an emphasis is put on recycling, have great impacts. There is a divide between those who feel climate change is an issue and those that actually strive to alter our future. Without incentive or ease, something like UVA wide recycling becomes less attainable. Many buildings where students live have either no option to recycle or it is not as accessible as the trash. By making the ‘green’ options the easy options, it limits this divide and makes the decision that’s better for our environment the go-to. 

Furthermore, there is one large change that I would like to discuss that would have a tremendous effect on greenhouse emissions here at UVA. Many people are unaware of how food production and food waste play a major part global warming. Animal agriculture not only contributes a substantial amount to greenhouse gases, but a reduction in the consumption of grazing animals like cattle and sheep would allow for millions of hectares of grassland to become available for forestry. In a college setting, dining halls promote the tendency to waste food and resources, as students tend to grab many different plates and rarely finish one selection before sampling another. Furthermore, by setting food out, it must be thrown away if it isn’t eaten. This is not only bad for climate change but it’s bad for budgeting. Millions of dollars can be lost to throwing out excess food and producing more than is needed. Obviously, this is a problem that would take lots of time and energy to change, as feeding mass groups of students is difficult enough on its own. Altering dining halls to be more waste efficient could start with small changes and slowly move up. Things such as setting up food waste committees or striving to compost are the first steps toward reducing food waste. Additionally, things could be put into place like only using one or two plates at a time, or looking towards using what would be thrown away for other purposes. 

Thankfully, there are many more options to discuss and many possibilities for growth.  
Together, we can work to better our community and better our planet. I look forward to being a part of the change that drives UVA’s future. Thank you, President Ryan for your time.

community,"First, I must say that I’m delighted to know that you’re taking climate change seriously and that you’re interested in how UVA can enhance its sustainability over time. With that, I’ll get straight to the point: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently projected that—even if we take aggressive action to limit our emission of greenhouse gases—the global average temperature will rise by 2 – 4° Celsius by the end of the century. That might not sound like much warming, b...ut to give you an idea of the implications, let’s consider the last ice age: Back then, it was roughly 5° Celsius cooler than it is today, and we had a totally different world. So, given that we might cause 4° of warming on the high end, we’re talking about a human-caused change in temperature which could totally remake the planet. More still, it took the planet 10,000 years to change from the ice age’s temperature to today’s temperature, but the projected warming of    2 – 4° would take place in 100 years! In short, we’re warming the planet far too much and far too quickly. 
To give you an idea of the impacts of the last century’s warming, Charlottesville experienced fewer than 5 extreme heat days per year at the beginning of the last century, but today, it experiences 15 such days. Worse still, by 2050, we can expect 39 of these deadly days per year if we don’t take steps to mitigate the impacts of climate change. For UVA, this means an increased frequency of extreme weather events like heat waves and floods which pose threats to our infrastructure, food supply, and student health.
But the good news is that UVA can take steps to mitigate the impacts of climate change. We can start by improving our energy efficiency. By reinsulating our buildings, we could reduce the amount of energy used to heat and cool them. We can start with the on-Grounds dormitories and apartments before moving on to academic buildings and athletic facilities. I recommend that we aim to achieve this goal by 2030.
The biggest thing we can do to make our Grounds more sustainable is reduce our carbon emissions. Our best bet is to electrify everything—starting with university vehicles like buses and maintenance trucks. We should aim to electrify 50% of our vehicles by 2030 and 95% by 2050. But the most important thing we can do to reduce our carbon emissions is change our energy mix. More specifically, we should phase out our use of coal, the most carbon intense of all energy sources, and transition to using renewable, carbon-zero sources like solar energy. Regarding milestones for reducing our use of coal, we can use the IPCC’s recommendations: 60% less coal by 2030 and no coal by 2050. More generally, by 2040, we should aim for 50% of the University’s electricity to be produced by renewable energy sources. To this end, we could install a web of solar power receptors on our rooftops.
Still, there is an even more aggressive and symbolic course of action: cut funding ties from companies that dispute or deny climate change. Schools like Stanford, Yale, and UC Berkeley have already begun divesting their endowments of funds from companies that contribute to the climate change crisis—essentially pulling investments out of fossil fuels and investing, instead, in a more sustainability-friendly industry.
But if all of this seems like a bit too much, there’s a wealth of lower hanging fruit that presents quick and inexpensive ways of making a big difference. For one, we could discontinue the groundskeepers’ use of nitrogen-based fertilizes because they release methane, the most potent greenhouse gas. Starting with landscaping and then shifting focus to our athletic fields, we should aim to reduce our use of nitrogen-based fertilizers by 50% by 2030. I also recommend that we create—or, perhaps endow—a course focused on the interplay between climate science and sustainability practices. This could satisfy the College’s math and science requirement, but more importantly, it could empower students to enact localized change—not only here and now in Charlottesville, but also back in students’ hometowns and for the rest of their lives. 
Lastly, we could rather easily address the problem of food waste, a vastly overlooked driver of climate change which produces about 8% of global warming. To reduce food waste in our dining halls, we can do four things: First, we can go trayless. Without a tray, students will only take what they can hold, which means students will be more conservative about what they’re actually going to eat. Second, we can connect with a food-waste reduction network which could convert food waste into potting soil, livestock feed, or even biodiesel. Alternatively, we could coordinate with a local shelter which I’m sure would be happy to arrange a regular pick-up from our dining halls. Third, we could start a student-run composting initiative which could collect compostable organic matter while also educating students about composting. And fourth, we can raise awareness about food waste in our dining halls. Starting the conversation about food waste can do more than might you think. According to a new study, college students throw out 15% less food when dining halls post anti-waste slogans and messaging around the cafeteria. Better still, if an administrative infrastructure is put in place to regulate our reduction of food waste, students could serve as the manpower behind the effort to reduce food waste, making our course of action cheaper while also empowering and educational.
As we begin our third century, we have the opportunity to address a set of fundamental questions. What are our dreams and aspirations for the University? What is our purpose as a public university? What impact can UVA have on the commonwealth, nation, and society at large? As I see it, making our Grounds more sustainable is a crucial part of answering all of these questions. The recommendations I’ve made can help us tackle our carbon emissions, mitigate the anticipated impacts of climate change, and manage the expected increase in the cost of energy, while ensuring we improve the quality of the University’s environment for both staff and students. With that, let’s set the standard for renewable energy. Let’s lead the way in making America’s universities more sustainable. And let’s lead this generation into a greener, more sustainable future.

community,"Recently the IPCC released a report in October 2018 describing what has happened already with 0.5 degree increase to our system. Already there has been a significant amount of negative impact. In order to slow this process down, fossil fuels have to be mitigated by hitting certain targets of improvement. There needs to be a lower demand for energy globally, because in turn there are a significant amount of lengthy consequences afterwards. In order to do this change, technology needs to be signif...icantly more efficient. The IPCC has already mentioned a few major changes necessary to become more efficient in the decades to come. There needs to be an increase in renewable energies so more wind and solar power is needed. Transportation needs to be altered to primarily use electric means of travel. Forest’s also need a significant amount of protection, because they take up CO2 in the atmosphere. Along with that, the protection and carefulness with maintaining thriving agriculture is vital in taking up CO2 as well. Money used in taking care of the environment needs to be altered and carefully planned out. Investing in the “worst case scenario” is important for protection later on as well. Overall, it becomes an effort amongst everyone in this world to make sure these targets are met and changes are to be made. Those individuals in higher positions need to take advantage of their leadership and promote attention to these issues. From these higher-level people to the everyday person, changes are needed across the board. 
Although a lot of the major changes necessary are quite large and complex for the typical college student at UVA, there are reasonable lifestyle changes that can be made amongst the student body for progress and a more efficient environmental world. Some of which include: avoiding food waste by eating all leftovers, eating more plants and smaller animals, such as birds, walking and biking places, to driving in a carpool, following basic environmental skills of reduce, reuse, and recycle, and finally voting and having one’s voice heard about the vital changes one wants to see in the world. 
I believe the task as a singular person in a large world seems so unobtainable and far-fetched, yet in reality, if everyone did their part, there would be drastic changes in the bigger picture. Starting with small, everyday efficient changes is an amazing place to start, following with the university’s efforts to help promote and maintain these goals. Maybe with some incentive or competition it would make being efficient a fun and exciting task. I believe that everything will fall into place once people start making these changes. Showing videos or pictures of what will happen to the world can be eye opening to many. I think everyone at UVA would love to help, and they do not want to see their world around them slowly get destroyed because of their actions; yet, most people are not quite aware of just how bad the situation is and has been for a long time. People do not spend much time researching climate change in their everyday lives, so finding ways to express the pressing need for change to the student body as a whole, through perhaps everyday social media, would be very crucial. 
Change is possible and global targets can be met, but it stems from each person on their own. Our earth is too magnificent and beautiful to allow us to ruin it by being careless and naive. We as youth need to act and take control of our world for the betterment of ourselves and those to come.

community,"As a student at the University of Virginia, a citizen of the United States of America, and a living being on planet Earth, I have a genuine and consuming fear of climate change. This fear spurs not only from the extremely apparent lack of action, but also the lack of understanding the world has for the necessity of change. Currently as a planet our goal is to limit warming to 2°; however, with the way we are going as a planet we are not on track for 2° warming. Aside from this fact, 2° warmin...g also creates dangerous conditions in impoverished areas who are already experiencing extreme conditions. This means that we must aim to limit warming to 1.5° in order to help not only impoverished countries around the world, but also to prevent climate change from impacting our futures and the lives of people we care about.
In the coming decades UVa must commit to establishing a set and somewhat radical plan for change. The University has an immense amount of power and influence upon their students and the environment. Sustainability at UVa is a very impactful force with their insistence on recycling and encouragement of students to limit their carbon footprint and water usage. However, the small things that students can do must be pushed and encouraged even more. It should be required for students in dorms to learn about all the ways they can reduce the amount of energy they use because it is so easy to take a shorter shower, eat all your food to reduce waste, and turn the lights off when you’re not in. Along with dorm information sessions regarding sustainability, there should also be a module of some sort at the beginning of the year reiterating statistics surrounding climate change and the dire need for change especially because climate change impacts our futures just as much as the other topics covered in modules.
UVa has made efforts previously to reduce emissions and has been successful in reducing its carbon footprint. However, change must be made more rapidly in order to limit the warming our world is facing because to achieve a 1.5° limit we will have to eventually start negative emissions and with the longer we take to reduce emissions the more difficult this process will become. What UVa can do to help, is to make a plan to make their changes more rapid. This includes more solar powered buildings and taking advantage of the science that allows us to use renewable resources. Our university has the power to make change and if we publicize and motivate our students to take action in preventing climate change, and show the changes our university is making to stop it, we will be able to make a more rapid and impactful presence in the limiting of our world’s warming to 1.5°.

community,"My name is Zach Marhanka and I am a First Year here at the University of Virginia. Throughout my life, I have always been interested in climate science, specifically what we as humans can do to limit our effect on the environment around us. During this semester my interest has been fueled by one of the classes I am taking, “An Inconvenient Truce: Climate, You, & CO2”. As a student of Professor Lawerence, it has come to my attention that there are steps the UVA community and Board of Visitors... can take to limit our footprint. 
As a student, I have noticed various aspects of our University environment that we can limit. Of these aspects, I have narrowed my observation to the University Transit System, Dining System, and Residence Halls. 
Our UTS system could be improved with regards to the wasted energy that comes with an excess amount of transit buses. Although it is beneficial for students to have multiple busses along a single route, it is unneeded, especially at obscure times of the day. Often I have noticed that certain routes will go unattended by students within certain hours of the day. On the other hand at certain times of the day buses will be completely packed. Perhaps the student body, maybe a group of students interested in city planning, could improve the bus system so that space is maximized on bus routes throughout the day. If it is possible to reduce transit emissions it could help make a more eco-efficient bus system. 
Methane is one of the worlds leading greenhouse gases behind carbon dioxide. Although it is not in as great of abundance as CO2, its warming power is 20 times that of CO2, so it plays a large role in our human emissions. You may be asking, where does this methane come from? The answer: cows. Red meats should be limited as a food option on dining hall menus for chicken and fish or possibly healthier alternatives. If the school can limit its consumption of red meat, we will be able to reduce how much red meat we buy, in turn reducing the number of cows possibly used for consumption. If the dining halls can limit their dependence on the product in certain meals then we can easily reduce our school’s methane consumption. 
One other option that can be fulfilled to reduce energy waste is how we consume energy in student dorms. Often students who are not aware of the environmental impacts that come with excess consumption of energy will leave lights on in rooms they are not using. Although there was if I am correct an energy-reduction “competition” between the First Year dorms, the competition was barely pressed upon students. In fact, I am only remembering it as I write this email. The University should incentivize or push for a greater reduction in energy use in the daily lives of students. Whether that be through a more publicized competition or some sort of incentivized goal for dorms to reach regarding a lack of consumption, the UVA community should pick itself up in reducing our dorm-life footprint. 
I hope you will consider some of the points I brought up that affect the UVA community's effect on our local environment.

community,"Global warming is becoming a bigger problem with every new day that passes, and we are now reaching rates of global warming we have never experienced before. Temperature changes that were previously predicted to take thousands of years are now occurring within the span of a few decades. With the current policies set in place, the world will reach global warming levels of 3.4 degrees Celsius warmer within the next century. This is a huge change, as only about 3-5 degrees Celsius represents the di...fference between the temperatures of the Ice Age and the temperatures today. So, what can we do here at UVA to help put a stop to these trends?
            There are many simple steps that everyone can take to help reduce fossil fuel emissions and slow the rate of global warming. For example, something as simple as making sure you finish all the food on your plate can make a large difference. If we completely eliminate the food waste that humans are producing, we would take away 25 percent of the 2030 reduction goal set by the IPCC. In addition to this, substituting chicken or turkey in for beef can make a large difference, too. The IPCC has set a goal to reduce the emissions from methane found in the guts of cows and sheep by half, so making it a point to eat less red meat and more white meat can start the process of completing this reduction. These are examples of small, easy steps that every student here can take to help get us to our goal of a 1.5-degree Celsius temperature change in the next century. 
             There are also some larger scale changes that the university itself can take to help reduce emissions. There is a nationwide goal set to have almost 75 percent of all energy in buildings be electric by the year 2050. The heating of buildings accounts for a large amount of fossil fuel emissions put out into the environment, so if we change even a few of the buildings on Grounds to be heated solely off of electricity, we can jumpstart the progress to reach this goal. In addition to this, there is a goal to have one to two thirds of transportation be electric vehicles by the year 2050. If we can start looking into ways to make the Charlottesville Area Transit system buses electric, that would create huge reductions in emissions on Grounds. Another change the university can make is to start using solar energy to power things on Grounds. This could be as easy as creating solar powered charging stations, vending machines, or street lights. 
            While these changes will be expensive for the university, and further the nation as a whole, it’s nothing that we can’t handle. It has been predicted by the IPCC that the United States will have to spend 900 billion dollars a year to reach the 1.5-degree temperature change we are striving for. While this number seems very large, we are already spending half that much in debt payments, and we spent twice as much as that on military expenses just last year. This shows that this is definitely a price the world can handle, and should do so in order to start the progress towards the goal we are trying to achieve within our environment.

community,"As a dedicated member of the UVa community, I want to advocate the importance of sustainability on grounds. Climate change is an epidemic, and as a community we have to work together to combat it. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 97% of the world’s scientists believe that climate change is happening because of our emissions. We caused the problem, and now we have to fix the problem. In order to secure the prospect of a healthy future for the next generations, we need... to reduce warming to 1.5 degrees celsius by 2100. If we do not act on climate change, by 2100 we will see warming of 4 degrees celsius or more—which is detrimental to basic survival. This problem is global, but changes in the UVa community can make a big difference.

I’ve comprised a list of ways that UVa could potentially reduce its carbon footprint:

1.	We could eliminate red meat from UVa dining facilities, as the feed, fertilizer, and fuel required when raising livestock releases toxic chemicals into our atmosphere.
2.	We could be sure we’re using efficient bulbs, and we could inform students about the importance of efficient bulbs when they choose to furnish their own apartments or add supplementary lights to their dorm rooms.
3.	We could make strides for our transportation systems to be as environmentally friendly as possible; or better yet, we can advocate for students to walk to class, if able. 
4.	We could promote student run gardens and express the importance of composting.
5.	As a community, we need to talk about climate change:

Overarchingly, we need to spread the word to make sure everyone is informed. The UVa community is comprised of conscientious, compassionate, and bright people—it’s our duty to make sure our colleagues know the cost of climate change. Speaking from personal experience, learning the truth about climate change has been revolutionary. I am a first year student, and climate was not on my radar prior to my enrollment in EVSC 1450: An Inconvenient Truce: Climate, You and CO2. Beginning as mere way to fulfill degree requirements, the class has far exceeded my initial expectations and changed my perspective for the better. As the semester comes to a close, I feel like I have evolved as a community member. I understand the gravity of climate change and I feel passionately about making strides to stop it. I am so grateful I have had the opportunity to become informed, and I want every person in the UVa community to have that experience. 

Since not every student will opt to take EVSC 1450, it is the duty of the university to emphasize the importance of protecting our earth. I’ve seen positive signs throughout the dining hall and dorms that promote the conservation of water and reiterated the vitality of minimal food waste, but we can do more. Maybe our RAs could give talks to residents about ways to reduce their carbon footprints in dorms or maybe the UVa instagram could post tips for the community about how to be greener; regardless of the means by which we choose to talk about it, the climate needs to be discussed. 
The simplest way to promote change is by talking about what we need to do as a community. I can say with conviction that I will never forget what I have learned this semester in EVSC 1450, and I want every member of our community to be able to understand the cost of climate change, as it is vital to a thriving future. As passionate members of society, how can we argue against a thriving future? The next generation depends on us, now. Change can start in Charlottesville.

community,"Our world is rapidly changing. Each year is getting warmer than the last, the ice caps and forests are shrinking, and hurricanes are getting more and more destructive. We need to address our earth’s changes head on. These changes have been proven to be anthropogenic over and over again by scientists all around the globe. It is time that the University of Virginia plays its role in saving our planet. 

But despite our current meager efforts (eliminating straws in dining halls, having composta...ble containers, and motion sensored lights in dorms), we are not doing enough. We all have the responsibility, to reduce fossil fuel emissions. According to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control) the world will change dangerously if the temperatures reach 1.5 degrees over the preindustrial levels. The ice caps will melt, the seas will rise, natural disasters will become more severe and more frequent, and water will become more scarce if we do not make incredible change today and in the next few years. If we want to keep warming below 2℃  and ideally 1℃, we are going to need to rapidly reduce the amount of CO2 we emit. The IPCC predicts that we will need to complete eliminate fossil fuel use by 2055 and leading up to that we will need to be energy efficient and transition towards renewable energies. We are far from being completely dependent on renewable energies, so we must being as soon as possible and swiftly replace coal with solar, oil with wind, natural gas with nuclear. 

The primary way to reduce our emissions is to use renewable energies- solar, wind, nuclear, geothermal. The UVA facilities management website says “The University of Virginia district heating plants used 1,290,275,000,000 Btu of natural gas, coal, and oil to provide 84% of the heating energy used at the University. The main heat plant used 94% of that to produce 986,929,000 pounds of steam at 180 psi and 380⁰F.” If we could eliminate coal and heat our dorms with an alternative energy source our carbon emissions would decrease dramatically. The UVA sustainability website reveals that “Electricity consumption represents the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions at UVA, accounting for 55% of the University’s carbon emissions in 2013.” We have begun to reduce our energy consumption; The Energy efficiency projects through UVA’s Delta Force program have “reduced total energy consumption of 37 buildings by 11% since 2009. That’s equivalent to over $22 million in avoided costs.” But we still have a long way to go. Also using less energy saves the university millions of dollars. This would be an investment- financially, for our health, and for our planet.

Using exclusively reusable energy is the long term goal but in the meantime we can work on reducing the amount of energy we use. Our buildings can be made more energy efficient by adding insulation so less heat is needed to warm them in winter and cool them in the summer. The amount of lights can be reduced as well by having more and better placed windows that allow sunlight to come in throughout the day. Solar panels can be added to the roofs of dorms, academic buildings, and dining halls. Having electric busses on grounds would also reduce carbon (if our electricity source was not coal powered). 

One way to reduce our school’s carbon footprint is to have less meat at the dining halls and increase the vegetarian and vegan options. Meat, especially beef, produces tons of carbon and uses an incredible amount of water.  Another option we can integrate into our dining is having more local foods. The emissions from the transportation of food adds to our energy consumption. Getting food from the US or better yet Virginia, will help. To further help the environment, the school should provide compostable containers at Meal Exchange locations and having compost bins around grounds.

	With a few key changes, UVA can be a better place both for students and the planet. Will you be the president who takes on this challenge head on or will you turn a blind eye?

community,"My name is Chloe Leo, and I am a first-year at UVA from Washington, D.C. I am writing today to tell you my vision for UVA’s future. It is crucial that the human race works together to limit warming to 1.5° C. We are currently on track to warm 3.4° C by 2100. Even the goal set by the Paris Agreement, limiting warming to 2° C, is simply not good enough if we wish to avoid grave consequences. The consequences of warming of 2° C higher than pre-industrial levels would include more fatally hot...days, dangerous sea level rise, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These would further lead to species extinction, destruction of infrastructure, and various risks to public health. 

The good news is that these catastrophes can be avoided; We’ll simply have to work really really hard. UVA is an exemplary University. We are a leader in sports, in the arts, in research, and in nearly every academic discipline. We must work to become a leader in sustainability. 

Many amazing programs are already in place to encourage sustainability. That being said, we still have a long ways to go. UVA must encourage individuals to decrease their own carbon footprints by utilizing public transportation, cutting down on waste, reducing their consumption of beef, pork, and lamb, and decreasing their energy usage by shutting down appliances when not in use. These things are easier said than done. UVA should incentivize sustainable practices by giving out freebies such as free gear or gift cards. Additionally, UVA could give out water bottles and reusable tumblers to encourage waste reduction. Another way to decrease waste would be by banning non-reusable coffee cups on campus beginning with dining halls, forcing students to bring reusable thermoses. 

While reducing individual emissions is incredibly important, it is not enough. As an institution, we must significantly reduce our fossil fuel consumption and transition to the use of renewable energy. One way to do this would be to install solar panels on UVA buildings. While these are expensive, they will decrease UVA’s energy expenses, and therefore likely pay off in the long run. Another way to reduce our emissions is by relamping. Changing the lighting in Alderman library resulted in an electrical usage reduction of 328,791kilowatt hours and savings of $27,256 in 2014, according to the UVA sustainability website. If we relamp all old buildings at UVA, we can significantly decrease our emissions while saving money. This money can then be used to fund additional sustainability projects and initiatives. 

In line with the UVA sustainability plan, I propose that The University reduce greenhouse gas
emissions 25% below 2009 levels by 2025. In order to do this, it is essential that we reduce our energy usage and waste production. This would include reducing our total tonnage of waste generated by 50% below 2014 amounts by 2035 and reducing our building energy use intensity by 20% below 2010 levels by 2020. 
There will be no future for UVA if we do not save our planet, and there will be no planet if we do not collectively reduce our Greenhouse Gas emissions. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.

community,"My name is Cristina Zarhloul and I am a second year at the University of Virginia. I write to you because I am concerned about the future of climate change, and believe that UVA could take some big steps to help prevent it. The IPCC deems that we are currently on a path of having the Earth heat up by around 2-5 degrees Celsius in the next 100 years. This would literally be catastrophic, as sea levels would rise so much that many U.S. coastal cities would not be able to exist anymore, and most of... our money would have to pour into repairs and energy efficiency in order to survive. People living in extreme temperatures would have to migrate to cooler areas, which would in turn cause major policy issues outside of the environmental sector. 
I believe UVA should be a leader in preventing climate change among universities nationally. Not only would this give UVA a great reputation, it would encourage other schools to follow UVA’s footsteps because of all of the positive recognition UVA would receive. UVA could start an epidemic throughout universities that would hopefully encourage institutions beyond universities to also join in. You could be the president to make this happen. You could make UVA go down in history as a leader in preventing climate change.
How can UVA do this? There are many ways. First I will begin with the ways that will cost some investment now, but will save us from massive costs in the future in response to damages made by climate change. The university’s transportation system could have one of the biggest impacts. First, adding more bus routes will encourage more students to use public transportation and lower the necessity of bringing cars to school. There are almost no bus routes on the UVA bus system that stop at The Corner. While I understand that The Corner is not considered “on grounds”, it is a spot where many UVA students (if not most UVA students) live.  There are many reasons why students living on the corner need transportation such as to go grocery shopping, to get somewhere safely after dark, or to get to practice/ club events. Because students living on the corner do not have many options for public transportation, they bring cars to school. Putting more bus routes on the UVA corner, and even more bus routes to grocery stores would lessen the amount of cars students use. 
Furthermore, the buses used at UVA should be completely battery hybrid. This would lessen the amount of pollution that goes into the air due to buses. “Safe Ride” cars should also be either electric or fuel-efficient. Also, for students who have a car and live on grounds, they should get free or reduced-cost of parking if they have a fuel efficient or electric car. Having all modes of transportation completely green would have a huge impact on the amount of emissions UVA gives off. 
 Aside from fixing transportation, all light bulbs on campus should be energy efficient. We also should only use green electricity. There should be solar panels on the tops of buildings and we should also have wind turbines to generate energy. Only renewable energy should be used at UVA. While this may be expensive now, it would have huge impacts in the long run.
Aside from expensive changes UVA should make to help climate change, there are some things we could do that would cost very little. We need to avoid food waste. I am sure much of the food at the dining halls goes uneaten every day. All of the uneaten dining hall food should be donated to homeless shelters.  This would require one employee to act as a liaison between UVA and the shelters and also a truck for transportation. Globally, if we prevented food loss it would reduce emissions by 12%. We need to start making changes regarding food waste here at UVA. Starting small can create a big difference. 
I hope you will consider what I have outlined in this letter, as UVA could be a major influencer on the world.

community,"If global emissions proceed as predicted, there will be approximately 39 deadly hot days in Charlottesville a year by 2050, compared to single digit number that we have now. The University of Virginia should be a university that is very concerned with climate, as almost 90 peer institutions have declared. Climate change is becoming something that impacts our lives in a tangible way: it is no longer some far-off fear: it is here and it is important. The globe should aim to keep the global tempera...ture rise under 1.5 C, for a variety of economic and safety reasons. 
Cornell has already reduced their emissions by 30% since they announced their green initiative 10 years ago. Friends of mine that go to Cornell will confirm that the environment is an important concern of the university. They plan to be completely carbon neutral by 2035, a time frame that is far above the rest of the world. Scientists currently think that in order to keep emissions below 1.5 C, global emissions will need to be carbon neutral some time near 2055—Cornell is exceeding that goal. 
Similarly, Stanford’s incorporation of their SESI plan has reduced emissions by 68%. They previously operated solely on fossil fuels, and now have transitioned to grid sourced electricity and electric heat recovery systems. This system is now endorsed by the International Energy Agency. 
The University of Virginia should take after the likes of Cornell and Stanford. Instead of being a follower, UVA should be a leader in the climate initiative. We cannot let peer institutions dwarf us as the topic of environmental concern is becoming more important. I am aware of UVA’s plan to reduce emissions by 25% by 2025. I think we can do better. The university also hopes to reduce potable water use by 2035 by 25% below 2010. Certainly these goals are important, but they are challenged by other universities. 
Climate change is certainly an important concern in my life, and I think it should be talked about more around grounds, as well as addressed in a more time efficient manner by UVA. I have met multiple people during my short three months on grounds that vocally do not believe in climate change. While I know this can be very political, I think it is very important for more people to know more about climate change. Everyone who claimed to be a change denier had no information to back that up. That needs to change. Challenge and opposition is necessary in a healthy university environment, but information and facts need to accompany the doubt. UVA should take after Cornell and Stanford, in hopes to help the globe to keep emissions below 1.5 C in place of the previous 2 C goal.

community,"In an effort to limit warming to 1.5 degrees in the world we must make an effort to target electricity generation, energy supply, transportation, buildings, food and land. To limit warming, efforts must be made in all of these areas, not just a few. Even though limiting warming to 1.5 degrees will be expensive, it is most certainly worth it. It is an investment that will save us more than just money in the long run, it will keep us secure and safe. 
	A major way we can do this at UVA is by trac...king and measuring the food waste at on-grounds dining halls around campus and making a conscious effort to reduce that by 2%. There are a variety of ways to do this, including making smaller portion sizes available or ordering and making less food to begin with. Another way UVA Dining can improve is by serving more chicken and turkey as opposed to red meats. By substituting chicken or turkey for beef, lamb or pork in the dining halls, each person who eats there regularly can reduce their emissions by 4%. On a more holistic level, UVA Dining can also increase the amount of plant options available to hopefully decrease the amount of meat they have to use. 
	Another way we can do this at UVA is by lowering/raising the temperature in different classrooms and buildings throughout Grounds. Often, a few degrees won’t make too much of an impact on our personal comfort level but will greatly decrease the amount of energy we use. 
	At UVA, we have an awesome bus system. However, it can be hard to figure out how to use. If all students knew how to use the bus and utilized it, especially if they began taking the bus to places like Barracks Road Shopping Center and the AFC instead of taking their own individual cars, we can greatly reduce the amount of emissions. One way to make sure all students can effectively and efficiently navigate the transportation system at UVA would be to give a quick tutorial on how to use it at orientation for new students. 
	It would be a great idea to start fundraising efforts for some investments to make UVA a more energy efficient school. Students here are great at raising money and extremely passionate about important causes. Some investments UVA could make would be to put rooftop solar panels on some of the buildings and replace regular lightbulbs on grounds with energy efficient light bulbs. A more expensive, but just as beneficial investment would be to replace the transportation vehicles with energy efficient ones. 
	With all of these ideas and changes, UVA can be a big help and contributor to keeping warming to 1.5 degrees.

community,"With the current rate our world is going, and if no policies are put to use, we expect around a
3-4 increase in degrees celsius by 2050. This is a shockingly dangerous amount, and much of
our world would change in terms of environment if we resorted to this situation.
Having said this, each individual can do their own part to make a difference so that the idea of
the ‘Paris Goal’, that is only a 2 degree increase in celsius, can be achieved. The University
itself can do its part to help... reach this goal.
There is currently less than 5% of renewable energy transport that is being used worldwide.
One thing that UVa can do is have their faculty and maintenance vehicles switched to
electricity powered cars. This can also include the UTS buses. They can also promote the use
of electric cars by providing charging ports at local garages. In addition, the buildings can have
solar panels installed to power their lights and other sources that use energy. A less expensive
and more feasible option would be to ensure all light bulbs are LED and energy efficient, as well
as motion powered to reduce costs as well as energy usage.
Another huge source of inefficient greenhouse gas emissions is the amount of food waste. If
food waste were a country, it would be the third greatest greenhouse gas emitter after USA.
Something UVa can do to help this is ensure all dining halls start composting leftovers. In
addition, substituting red meats that may be served such as beef, lamb or pork with chicken
and turkey can reduce emissions by 4%. This is both a more health conscious and a more
environmentally conscious option. The dining hall can also expand its vegan and vegetarian
options, so more students would be compelled to eat vegetarian.
Also in terms of transport, we could encourage more walking and the use of bicycles by
providing incentives such as free UVa merchandise to those who walk or bike rather than use a
car.
In addition, the recycling and reuse systems can be implemented further by switching all To-go
boxes to reuseable ones and not allowing a student more than 2 reusable boxes per semester.
They can also switch to compostable utensils offered with the to-go boxes and install more
compost bins across grounds for easy access. Furthermore, we can even go so far as to
encourage professors to provide some sort of incentive for being more environmentally efficient
for their students, such as one credit point on their exams. Finally, classes can take it more
seriously by cutting out paper exams and assignments and issuing them online on collab. They
can also encourage use of textbooks online rather than a paper book.
Doing even one of these things could help UVa be more environmentally efficient by huge
lengths, and I am positive the world would appreciate it.Read More",Student,Riya
community,"I am writing a letter this afternoon to discuss the concrete steps that the University of Virginia must take in order to limit global warming and reduce fossil fuel emissions in Charlottesville. In the last century, Charlottesville has had less than five days of extreme, deadly heat per year, but by 2050, if we are going at the rate we are going and do not take considerable action, that number will change to 39 deadly heat days per year. It is crucial that the University put our values into acti...on, and as an institution of higher learning, be a leader in the reduction of global warming with a goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
	The Paris agreement of reducing warming to 2 degrees Celsius is not good enough and we must take steps to have a goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The University must put a price on carbon either through cap and trade or carbon fee and dividend, something we are not doing right now. Doing so will allow the university to see there is a much higher cost to burning fossil fuels (the of carbon in our atmosphere) than simply the dollar amount it takes to pay for it. Therefore, all university owned buildings such as dining halls, dormitories, and academic buildings must be heated with electricity and not the burning of fossil fuels. Furthermore, more buildings should have rooftop solar panels and buildings should have more efficient bulbs and appliances. Furthermore, simply by not wasting food, the world will reach 12% of its goal to reduce global emissions. Therefore, UVA must take part in this by making sure food is not wasted in dining halls or the UVA hospital cafeteria. Perhaps switching the dining halls from all you can eat to specific choices in meals, there will be a significant decrease in food waste. Lastly, as a institution of higher learning, it is necessary that UVA is educating all its students about the very real effects of climate change and global warming. Therefore, I recommend that more advertising and resources are available for students to learn about the effects of climate change and warming. Doing so will cause more students to be aware— expanding programs and putting up signs next to university printers to print double sided and only use on sheet of paper next to bathroom sinks is crucial. Lastly, politics is directly involved with climate change and the goal of reducing global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Therefore, it is necessary that students are well informed so that they vote for candidates that support the need for the use of renewable energy as climate change effects every person on this globe. Although I realize that changing to renewable energy or switching the style by which the dining halls are run would have a lot of costs, it is far less than the cost of the carbon footprint that UVA is causing everyday. 
Taking these steps not only reduces emissions and leads to a more sustainable future, but as a an influential and highly credible university, being a leader on the reduction of fossil fuel emissions and switches to renewable energy will allow other institutions around the country and around the globe to follow our lead.

community,"I’m writing to you in an effort to increase sustainability and modify some of our practices around grounds. As I’m sure you know, climate change continues to grow at an exponential rate and its consequences are severe. Although UVA is only one institution, it is our responsibility as a leading university to take action and by doing so, we can set an example for other schools. UVA has done a great job of implementing some sustainable practices, such as the ROSE program, added recyclable bins,... and many others. These changes aren’t always easily implemented, as they often need additional funds and attention, but the outcome will be well worth it.

One of the areas around grounds that I feel could be improved upon in terms of sustainable practices is the dining department. Although they have recently made some shifts, I think they could be more dramatic and better publicized to gather student attention. For example, they recently introduced re-usable dining containers; however, when I go to the dining halls, they are never on display. When I ask for a to-go box, I feel as if it should be a routine for the cashier to ask, “would you like the reusable one or the cardboard one?”. It doesn’t seem like a big change, but it may make a student reconsider and take a re-usable one. Furthermore, I believe that we should try to limit red-meat to only hamburgers and one other dish per week. Cows are responsible for huge amounts of methane, a leading greenhouse gas, and by reducing our intake of red-meat, we are doing a small part in limiting methane. Finally, I believe that we should limit our waste as much as possible. For example, I frequently see pans of food that are almost empty, but not quite, and they are still being discarded. If a dining employee could combine it with the new batch or just try to wait until the pan is completely empty, we could decrease our food waste. Furthermore, we could likely add a program in which we can donate any additional food to a shelter or another place where others could use extra nourishment.

I also believe that implementing challenges or programs with incentives to reduce UVA’s carbon footprint would be beneficial to raise awareness and improve our sustainability. For example, first-years recently had a competition to see which dorm could use the least amount of energy per person and the winning building got pizza and succulent plants as their reward. I believe we could think of other challenges like this and provide small, but meaningful incentives to foster change among students.

Although most of these aforementioned changes are small, I believe that they can allow us to begin to transition to even more sustainable practices around grounds. As a strong, influential university, we should do everything in our power to lead the way in addressing climate change.

community,"My name is Deirdre Powell, and I am a first-year student in the College of Arts and Sciences from Baltimore, Maryland. I am writing to you about the pressing issue of climate change. On December 12, 2015 the Paris Climate change agreement was signed by 175 parties—174 countries and the European Union. The goal of the Paris Agreement is to keep the increase in global average temperatures below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to limit the increase to 1.5°C to substantially reduce the risks... and effects of climate change. Work by the IPCC shows that 2° of warming would still be incredibly dangerous, so it is best that the world limits warming to 1.5°C. Change can start on even the smallest of levels. As one of the greatest educational institutions in the world, I believe that it is our duty to help set an example for other Universities around the country in doing our part to mitigate the effects of climate change. In order to do this, I propose we start making simple changes in the dining hall which can lead to huge impacts. 
First, did you know that if food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US? Frankly, this is baffling to me. Many people around the world and even in our country go hungry everyday so to think that all of this food is going uneaten when it could be going to hungry people in need AND it is the third largest emitter of greenhouse-gases is a huge issue. Therefore, through eliminating food waste, we will be able to make a huge impact on the goal of reducing emissions. At UVA, I propose we limit food waste through instituting a “one-plate” policy at the dining hall. More often than not, I see people grabbing many plates of food because they think that they will eat everything. However, as the old expression goes, their eyes turn out to be way bigger than their stomach, and many, many plates of food go to waste. Next, I have noticed that the dining halls serve a lot of pork as the meat of choice. It turns out that in terms of climate change mitigation efforts, eating animals with “2 legs” is much better than animals with “4 legs.” Did you know, that if you substitute chicken or turkey for beef, lamb, or pork for just five meals a week you can reduce your emissions by 4%? Therefore, the dining halls do not need to completely get rid of beef, lamb, and pork, however, they can limit serving it to two times per week. Finally, by eating more plants, did you know that you can double or triple your impact? In this way, I propose that the dining halls institute “Meatless Mondays” in which no meat is served at all on Mondays. 
Ultimately, there is no doubt that climate change is a huge issue for our world. However as shown through my simple propositions, huge adjustments are not necessary to create real impact. In this way, I hope that you will consider my suggestions to help UVA make an impact and be a leader in climate change mitigation. Thank you.

community,"Climate change poses a serious and dangerous threat to our future. In a time where the leader of one of the world’s most developed countries does not believe in this threat, it is imperative that UVA, as one of America’s leading universities, commits to a more sustainable future. 

In order for the world to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2020 before steadily declining to zero by 2055. The best way for UVA to participate in reaching this g...oal is by limiting our demand. Every unit of unused energy represents a unit of carbon dioxide that is not emitted into the atmosphere to linger there for 100s of years, warming the planet. Thus, UVA must become more energy efficient. Currently, the University remains heavily reliant on coal to heat and cool water for air conditioning, directly impacting our carbon footprint. The University could use less coal by finding better insulation for its buildings. To reach the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius fifty to sixty percent of the world’s electricity must come from renewable energy by 2030. The University has already placing solar panels on flat-roofed buildings, but we must continue implementing solar panels and must become more dependent on solar energy. Although these solutions require a lot of money and effort, our future depends on their implementation. 

However, for the time being, UVA can make smaller changes. The University can begin by minimizing food waste. In fact, by eliminating food waste, the world can take care of twenty-five percent of its 2030 reduction goal. The dining halls can put up signs reminding students to only put as much food on their plate as they can eat. In addition, more composting bins on grounds can help minimize UVA’s carbon footprint. The meat industry remains one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gases, and the dining halls only support the trade by serving beef or pork almost every day. Although the burgers in Newcomb are more plant-based than regular burgers, the production of beef and pork still requires significant amounts of water and still releases large amount of methane into the atmosphere. UVA can reduce emissions by about four percent by serving more chicken and less beef and pork in the dining halls. Furthermore, UVA should limit its water use. The sprinkles by first year dorms run almost constantly and often spray the pavement instead of the grass itself, leading to unnecessary water waste. Simply by running these sprinklers less, UVA can greatly benefit the environment. These small changes carry large consequences.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to seeing the changes the University will make to become more sustainable in the future.

community,"First off, I would like to thank you for creating the “Ours to Shape” initiative. I am beyond grateful to know that you care about our issues and want to make UVA a better place. I am a first year and I think it is amazing how we are both starting our journey here at UVA. Your inauguration was a wonderful event and I was very glad to be a part of it. 
I am in Professor Lawrence’s “An Inconvenient Truce: Climate you and CO2” class and we have learned about the devastating effects of cl...imate change. One alarming fact that we learned was that if we continue to follow current policies, the global temperature will rise 3.4 degrees celsius (6 degrees fahrenheit) by 2100 globally. However, certain places will experience more heating like other places. I am from Aspen, Colorado and I have seen how detrimental climate change is to our community. We have not had as much snow and precipitation recently which caused a big wildfire this past summer. It was horrifying to see my friends evacuating their houses in fear that that their houses may be burnt down when they return. Now I am part of the Charlottesville community and we are/will be seeing detrimental effects. While Charlottesville may not experience wildfires and a lack of snow, we are experiencing more deadly heat days per year. In the last century, Charlottesville had less than five deadly heat days per year. Currently, with 1 degree of warming, Charlottesville has 15 days of deadly heat days per year. Even scarier, by 2050, Charlottesville may experience 39 days of deadly extreme heat days per year. This is unacceptable.
Our best plan is to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees celsius. This will be a difficult task around the world as it will be expensive. However, if we do not act now and avoid risks, protecting our planet will become even more expensive and we will have less flexibility in future responses. One of the best ways to stay at the 1.5 degrees celsius goal is to reduce fossil fuel emissions. Coal energy must decrease by 60-80% around the world to reach 1.5 degrees celsius. This leaves a lot of room for more renewable forms of energy like wind, solar, and nuclear energy. The University of Virginia could help contribute to the reduction of coal if we consider renewable energy. 
The University of Virginia can take small steps to make a big change. We need to raise awareness about food waste around campus. If food waste were its own country, it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China and the US. By eliminating food waste, we can reduce global emissions by 12%! Another large contributor to climate change is the release of methane into our atmosphere. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and will have serious effects on our climate if we continue to release it. One way that we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions is by eating less red meat. These small actions that the University of Virginia can take will make a huge difference. 
The University of Virginia could be a pioneer in acting against climate change if we take greener steps. We can invest in efficient light bulbs and appliances, use greener electricity, and maybe even make our buses electric! It’s time to make a change. We stand with you President Ryan. Thank you for your time.

community,"I think that I can bring some new views and ideas on this problem since I grow up in China, a different background compares with most of the UVa’s students. Additionally, climate change’s problem is extremely severe in China and we have taken a lot of efficient improvements in saving our environment. Therefore, I would like to share those information with you and combine with the local situation in school in order to develop UVa’s version of efficient solutions. 
There are a lot that we c...an improve. We can focus on the targets of transportation, food, and daily supply. We can set times in finishing those targets, and gives specific instructions in how to achieve those goals. 
First of all, about transportation. I think that it would be better for UVa to replace all the bus in the UTS system to electronic ones. In my city in China, Shenzhen, we replaced all our buses to electronic ones. There are roughly 20000 buses in my city. That action helps a lot in saving the environment in my city. One significant result is that Shenzhen’s GDP rank No.3 in China in year 2017 with $350 billion, which almost equals to the GDP of the state of Maryland; however, with 1/16 in area. The air condition in my city is much better than that in Beijing since we’ve used a lot of renewable energy resources. There is a company called BYD in Shenzhen that provides all the electrical buses for the city, and it costs $200000 per car, which is much cheaper than the electrical bus’s price in America. Therefore, I recommend that the school can try to import bus from the company of BYD with much less cost and high quality, and replace all the bus in the school. If you want to do so, I can help you negotiate with the company of BYD in China. I think that by the time the school needs to renew the bus, probably within a few years, we can replace those buses into electrical ones.
Secondly, for the food part. I buy meal plan in all my semesters in UVa, and I found that since we only account the times we get into the dining hall instead of what you eat inside, many students waste their foods. For example, a plate of meal may include two chicken legs and rice by the side. I always see students only finish one chicken leg and throw the rest. I think that the school can serve the meal in a more specific way. They don't need to have a uniform way to give out the meal. Each student can say what they want and what they don’t want. In this way, we can save a lot of wasted food. Additionally, another option can be the school charges student based on the pounds of their food instead of how many time students get into the dining hall. In this way, students will definitely be more serious in choosing foods that they need. I think that these actions can take place as soon as possible.
Thirdly, about daily supply. After I come to America, one major difference in my daily life is about the use of paper, either the paper we use for printing and writing or the tissue in the restroom and dining hall. I realize that Chinese people consume much less paper per person than US’s people. It makes me feel that the paper is free. The price for printing is much expensive in China than in our school library. I did see many students print out things that they don’t actually need since the price is so low. Additionally, there are tissue boxes with tissues on each desk in the dining room. Often, I saw that students used three or four tissues in cleaning up their mouth but actually they could do it with only one tissue. Same situation happened in the restroom as well. I think that the school can control the use of paper and tissue and can raise the price of printing. I think that these actions can start immediately.
We do need to take actions to help our climate. UVa is a good place to start. I hope we can influence others as well

community,"The University should focus on its role concerning minimizing climate change. Especially regarding our current political state and where the climate is scientifically proven to be headed, we are all responsible to do our part as individuals and as a community to help save our earth. In order for our climate to experience minimal changes, we must limit global warming to 1.5° C above preindustrial temperatures. Currently, if we continue “business as usual,” we are on track to hit about 4-5°...C of warming; we must act now and fast to mitigate this warming. 

In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) most recent report, they list a goal of making 50-60% of our electricity come from renewable energy by 2050 to try and achieve minimal warming. I believe this is where UVA can play a major role in the City of Charlottesville’s green energy efforts. As listed under UVA’s website’s “Facilities Management” page, 84% of the University’s heating comes from natural gas, coal, and oil. The University could make more efforts to convert at least 20% of this into renewable heating. Because UVA’s buildings are so old, they take a lot of energy to heat. Starting an effort to update our old buildings’ structures to insulate heat may also be an efficient way to use less energy to heat UVA. 

Another effort that the University could make to reduce its effects on climate change is to emphasize reducing food waste. Though we have the Sustainability program at UVA, as a student I never knew how much food waste contributes to our global emissions. Only when I started taking an environmental science course this semester, did I realize how much food waste contributes to our global emissions. As we’ve learned in EVSC 1450, if food waste was its own country it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. Through the Sustainability program at UVA, the University can advertise minimizing food waste and demonstrate to students how much their seemingly small food waste adds up. Since I’ve been aware of this astonishing statistic, I have been more conscious of the waste I produce and have tried to diminish it as much as possible. 

There are many other options for UVA to be a leader in minimizing the effects of climate change other than the two I have included in this letter. Our future earth and our quality of life is in jeopardy because of the actions we have made in the past and continue to make now. It is up to us right now to change the way we live in order to provide a better life for ourselves and for our future children.

community,"The greatest threat we face as a community at the University of Virginia is climate change. As it stands now, humans are on track to raise the average temperature of the world between 3-5°C, an amount that may seem trivial while averaged across the world, but will yield disastrous consequences affecting the public health of the UVA community. As of now, we have already experienced 1° of warming, which has lead to an average of ten to fifteen deadly heat days a year in Charlottesville, up from...five a century prior. If we continue unchecked, this number can get close to forty by 2050, which will likely result in countless deaths among the UVA community. More importantly, climate change will damage the natural ecosystems within Charlottesville, thus degrading the beautiful grounds that two centuries of UVA students have come to appreciate. 
	Already with just one degree of warming, we have seen disastrous consequences, but the warming of our planet will only increase. Though UVA and much of the world at large has begun to take action on Climate Change, the resulting decrease in the rate of warming will be minimal at best. The lowest degree of warming we can physically limit ourselves at is 1.5°, however in order to achieve even that target, action needs to be taken that greatly exceeds what is currently being done. Thus it is critical that UVA works to do its part in making these changes, and works to become a leader both in the Charlottesville community as well as among peer universities. 
	In order to limit warming to 1.5°, renewable energy usage must increase four to five times by 2030, and coal usage needs to be cut by at least sixty percent. One way UVA can make changes is by reducing its dependency on coal and shifting energy production to renewables over other fossil fuels. To accomplish this, the University ought to spend a sum of money annually to gradually establish a presence of wind and solar energy collection on grounds, and make as quick a shift as possible to phase out coal. 
	Transportation is another area that needs to be addressed by the University in order to limit warming. By 2050, transportation needs to be at least sixty percent electric, and there is much the University can do to help accomplish this. Electric car chargers on grounds are always a good way to start, and may help encourage more students to drive electric vehicles. The University’s fleet of busses should also be improved, looking into solutions to have electric or biofuel busses which would significantly lower greenhouse gas output. Furthermore, more can be done to encourage students to choose university transportation over personal vehicles, perhaps by expanding bus routes and frequency to more areas off grounds. 
	Food waste is also another major contributor of global greenhouse gas emissions, as are the resources used to prepare it, and the types of foods produced. For example, beef is produced on farms that release large amounts of methane, often packaged and shipped long distances in non-recyclable plastic, and in many cases thrown away into landfills where they release more methane. To combat this, UVA must work with its dining contractors to locally source more food, reduce the prevalence of beef and meat in general on its menus, and encourage creative solutions to ensure no food is wasted. Finally, more information needs to be provided to students about UVA’s system of sorting recyclables and composting in order to ensure that the maximum potential for these programs is met. 
	Though these are all great ways to limit global warming, there are countless more ways that UVA can work to ensure it does its part in combating both the greatest threat to humanity and to the University itself. Though the cost of many of these solutions will be high, they are far less than the damage and deaths that will ensue if global warming is not addressed soon enough. There is a narrow path to ebbing off warming at 1.5° that is rapidly closing, and it is critical that we shape UVA as a leader in ensuring that path is followed without delay.

community,"I wanted to reach out to you as a student of the University of Virginia concerned with our university’s attempts to mitigate climate change. The topic has become thoroughly debated in recent politics, and being currently enrolled in Professor Deborah Lawrence’s Introduction to Climate Change has left me asking what can we do to help? After learning about mitigation tactics to help reduce our overall warming from a possible 3°C to about 1.5°C by 2100, I feel UVA should apply some techniques... to help obtain the lower temperature. By making our university a greener and more informed place, we can help the climate now and decrease the burden of the future. 

Mitigation can allow the globe to reduce its warming early and will be less expensive than pushing off the efforts to clean up our world to a later date in time. It is predicted that the future generations will be more affluent as history has seen according to Adam Dessler in his “Introduction to Modern Climate Change: Second Edition.” However, this increased affluence would make adapting to climate change more expensive in the future since we would have put more pollutants into the world, hence leaving the future a larger problem. While it is fair to say that climate change is no an inexpensive task to take up, there are means to go about cleaning the world at a smaller cost. According to Professor Lawrence, we have to reduce our CO2 emissions in order to decrease warming. The most productive means in reduction is switching our energy sources from coal and fossil fuels to renewable energy. While it can be seen around Grounds that greener initiatives have been set in motion, if we were to change our fuel sources for powering buildings over to renewable energy, we would be contributing more to the global issue. 

The university should be able to handle a switch over to renewable energy, even if it is just in small increments. 1.1% of UVA’s annual budget is $15 million according to Professor Lawrence. If that 1.1% was allocated to renewable energy, the university would be making a progressive impact on Charlottesville’s emissions. According to EnergySage, the average cost of solar panels in Virginia is $11,886 for installation. If the $15 million was spent on solar panels for the roughly 317 buildings at UVA, about 1,262 solar panels could be purchased: allowing about 4 panels per building. This would let the university spend less money on fossil fuels and make for a gradual switch to renewable energy. 

Other initiatives the university could take to be more environmentally friendly would be to inform the students of how they can contribute. By posting more emails or flyers around Grounds on tips to reduce personal emissions, the students can play a big part in our climate impacts. Recycling should be encouraged as well as not wasting food in dining halls, since lots of energy goes into the making and delivering of food products. All in all, information and recycling could help make our community greener. 

Lastly, a way to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere is through trees and plants. If the university could plant more trees or plants, we could reduce our local carbon further. 

Thank you for your time, and for allowing me to express my concerns about our impacts on climate change.

community,"Firstly, I want to applaud you and the University’s Sustainability Office for making the commitment to ensure a more sustainable Grounds for years to come.  However, while the work being done on Grounds is exceptional, I am writing to encourage you and the committee to look to changes that can be done in the greater Charlottesville community. Much of what gives the University of Virginia it’s unique identity is the town of Charlottesville and the beautiful rolling hillsides and mountains tha...t surround it.  Climate change and the estimated 2 degrees Celsius warming that is expected over the next hundred years will undoubtedly have an affect on the greater Charlottesville community — from the neighboring Shenandoah National Park to local pastimes such as hiking, wineries, craft breweries, and apple orchards.  The University has made an amazing commitment to being a positive actor to combat climate change on Grounds, but I believe the University also has the ability to help the local community become greener.

The University of Virginia is the largest employer in Charlottesville, and with that accolade comes the responsibility of being the steward of the Charlottesville community.  The University has the ability to enact unprecedented change by incentivizing the nearly 30,000 people who work for the University to make environmentally friendly decisions.  Subsidies such for driving an electric or hybrid personal vehicle, installing solar panels, or signing up for a recycling service are all steps that could be taken in order to influence people to make green decisions that they might otherwise not take.  By offering paid time off, workers of the University could supply countless volunteers for many of the environmental foundations in Charlottesville, such as the Ivy Creek Foundation, the Piedmont Environmental Council, Rivanna Conservation Alliance, Rivanna Trails Foundation, and the Nature Conservancy, to only name a few.  This should also be extended to the thousands of hourly employees at the University.  As a hourly-wage student employee, I can attest that there would be plenty of interest in a program wherein people were paid to do something other than their typical work.

More than anything, however, the ripple effects of this policy could produce change that is far reaching.  These steps could introduce the topics of environmentalism and sustainability at the dinner tables of an entire community.  Although there will certainly be an economic cost for such as program, I believe that it would be well worth it.  At worst, those who take advantage of the program just for the subsidies and change in scenery would still be making their community more Green.  And at best, these programs could be the push needed to inspire many more systemic changes in personal behaviors that could in turn affect the decisions taken by a whole community.

community,"As you embark on your new role here at the University of Virginia, I ask that you consider embarking on an old problem that poses a serious threat. Climate change is often mistaken as a global issue that can only be solved behind the closed doors of those in power. However, there are numerous actions we can take here on grounds to make a long-term difference. We are already seeing the detrimental impacts of climate change here in Charlottesville. With only a 1° increase we are seeing between te...n and fifteen days of extreme and deathly heat. there are small changes that we can implement in our housing, food and transportation on grounds to make a big difference and I believe our actions as UVa students, teachers and administrators will influence the world around us. 
As a second-year transfer student, I didn’t live in the dorms. However, school housing is a great place to start making changes. While costly to begin with, switching to efficient bulbs and appliances are small steps that will have positive impacts on our school and the world around us. In addition, green electricity and solar power would elevate the University as a truly green school and promise its success for students to come. Lastly, in my first-year dorm, I had a bottle-filling station which encouraged students to reuse their water bottles and fill them up rather than simply purchasing another. 
The dining halls are another good stepping stone. We could implement an initiative to make our cafeterias and the food we eat more sustainable for our students and our earth. In doing this, we could create more vegetarian friendly options. By this I mean having our amazing staff take part in producing healthy options that are also desirable to students. In addition to making our meals greener (literally!), we must avoid waste as a community. This could mean doing something as simple as giving students incentives to take less and clear their plate before going for seconds. One way to do this would be simply having reminders up around the dining halls. Another could be having a “suggestion box” in which students can drop their grievances about certain meals that they didn’t like in order to limit those meals ending up in the garbage. 
The last facet of our community to consider is one that we often take advantage of. The University of Virginia is a large campus with a population to match. Getting across campus for a class can be daunting, but walking is the best way to do it! We have to encourage our community to limit the urge to get in the car. I don’t have a car on campus and I have never been in a situation in which that was a hindrance. First years aren’t allowed to have vehicles on campus, which is a rule that could be implemented for second-years who live within a mile radius of grounds. When driving is the only option, there needs to be an increase in carpooling to avoid an excess of unnecessary vehicles. One way to accomplish this is to create a platform for ride-sharing. Students going home over break should have access to every other student going to the same place. If one student can sign up to drive and four others can go with them, we’re eliminating four extra cars driving to the same destination.  
There is so much we can do as a community to better our school and hopefully our world. These are just a few of small suggestions that would have a huge impact. I trust that you will consider these and all other initiatives in an effort to preserve not only our school, but the earth.

community,"I think that the University has incredible potential when it comes to sustainability. The
reminders to conserve water on that bathroom mirrors, wrapper recycling stations, and reusable
to-go boxes are great first steps toward going green. There are several additional actions that I
feel we can take around grounds to ensure that the University is doing everything in its power to
be as environmentally conscious as possible.
My first recommendation would be for the University to transition to...a majority of
renewable energy sources. It is no secret that the University uses coal as one of its main energy
sources. Why use coal when there are renewable energy sources that could end up saving the
University money in the long run? On average the payback time for solar panels is 8 years,
which means that in less than a decade University solar panels would pay for themselves with
the money saved on energy costs. There are three solar energy companies in Downtown
Charlottesville alone. I believe that a target to use at least 50% renewable energy sources by
2030 would be more than feasible.
I would also like to address how the University could become more sustainable with
regards to the dining halls. The majority of meal options for students include some kind of meat
product. I would encourage the University to cut down on the amount of beef, lamb, and pork
and substitute it with chicken or turkey. The environmental impacts of raising birds are far less
than that of other livestock. Incorporating more plant-based meal options in dining halls would
also be a step in the right direction. Based on personal experience, I would estimate that 80% of
meals in the dining hall contain meat. If we could shift that percentage to 60%, the impact of the
University’s dining halls on the environment could be reduced by an even greater margin.
The University Transit System is utilized by many students on grounds. By having a free
transportation system, the University is reducing the number of independent student and faculty
drivers. I believe we could go one step further. The University could reduce emissions by
converting all of the buses to electric vehicles. This transition would be an investment, like the
solar panels the buses would soon pay off their cost through the money saved on gasoline.
While on the topic of green transportation, I would also encourage the University to promote the
Facebook page “Hoos Driving.” This page allows fellow students to offer rides to peers heading
to the same final destination. Not only does the help the environment, but further the sense of
community among students.
The future is now. You have the power to dictate the future of the University. I truly
believe that our University has the ability to become a leader in environmentally conscious
programs throughout the state of Virginia. I hope you agree.Read More",Student,Lane
community,"In the coming decades, it has become clear that immediate action is necessary in order to prevent unsafe and otherwise harmful effects on our planet’s climate. Here at UVA, though we may only be one public institution in a pool of over 6,000 accredited higher education institutions, we are still able to make an impact on lowering our projected warming emissions, currently estimated at 3.5˚C, to 1.5˚C. There is already danger predicted if there were even to be a 2˚C in warming by 2100, as sh...own by work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. As a family of ‘Hoos, I believe that slowly, but surely, we will be able to make a lasting effect on helping to decrease emissions, decrease our carbon footprint, alter our resources so that they are sourced from safer and less destructive sources like renewable energy, all together as a University of Virginia community. 
In the words of our institution’s founder in his 1787 novel, Notes on the State of Virginia, even Thomas Jefferson was cognizant and in turn concerned for the welfare of his state an country’s climate, as well as the detrimental and destructive warming trends presented thus far. Flash forward over 200 years later and we still are yet to hit the peak of our greenhouse gas emissions, have yet to gain a majority view on the dangers of climate change as protests worldwide are detained and shut down. Though these goals may seem dauntingly high, we can make a change here at UVA. 
We as the UVA community could establish a monthly recurring day where it should be the goal for each and every UVA student to either remove an act that would harm the environment or add an act that shows advocacy for the prevention of dangerous global warming. Examples of actions that would harm the environment that students could exclude would include grabbing an extra plate of food they will not eat or even just buying a drink that comes with a plastic straw. Examples of actions that show advocacy for preventing dangerous climate change tabling to sell reusable metal straws around Grounds, joining in on signing a community poster pledging to be more “green” in future endeavors and actions, or even a small act like recycling a water bottle into the correct bin or following the paper towel dispensers’ instructions in all the bathrooms around Grounds to “Try Just One!”
In addition, we could also start making a transition to extending the CAT travel routes to extend farther than Barracks shopping center, alleviating the need for upperclassmen students to feel the need to have cars on Grounds. Extending the bus routes will benefit both the students of the community in their ease of not having to pay for gas costs, as well as the environment in the deduction of automobiles traversing around Grounds. Slowly making the shift to having the buses run on electrical or solar energy would be an option to consider, as well. 
Small acts such as these could amount to lessening the cognitive dissonance we as a community feel in terms of reacting to the dangers of climate change. Should we implement a monthly recurring day with intentions such as these, as well as the move to extend the CAT bus routes in Charlottesville as soon as it is feasible to do so, I believe that within the coming decades, maybe even years, the University of Virginia will overall become a brighter, greener, and more environmentally-friendly institution than it has ever been— an institution that would help in alleviating the concerns Thomas Jefferson professed back in the 18th century.

community,"I believe our purpose as students at the University of Virginia is to pursue excellence
here, so we can then better our city, state, country, and even the world. Some of us will become
excellent teachers that improve the education system. Others will become excellent doctors that
save lives. Some will even become excellent policymakers that ensure that everyone is given
equal opportunities. This betterment is what the world needs, but if we don’t focus on our
environment, we will have no...healthy, livable world to improve in our future.
I have been taking a class about climate change this semester, and the consequences of
our actions, as people, that I’ve learned about have been eye opening. If we continue to emit the
amount of greenhouse gases that we currently are, our climate temperatures will increase 4 to 5
degrees Celsius. While this may not sound catastrophic, the effects of this change will be
extremely costly. Our society is adapted to the climate we currently live in, but this increase in
temperature will lead to a world that we are not accustomed to. Extremely hot days will lead to
human suffering. Rises in sea level will lead to flooding that destroys coastlines. Storms will be
stronger and more frequent leading to lives lost and infrastructure damaged. Our world will be
far from enjoyable and will eventually reach a point that is basically unlivable.
Environmentalists have set a best case scenario goal for the United States to keep
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This goal will require great but doable changes. Our country
must turn to renewables for electricity and transportation by 2050. We must make our
technologies more energy efficient. Also, we have to take action to end deforestation and
increase healthy forests and agriculture. To make the changes we need to protect our world, our
country would have to spend 1.1% of the national GDP. My proposition is that UVA takes action
to make these changes in our community to help keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius because I
truly believe we can achieve excellence.
Firstly, I propose some easy changes that we can make to improve our energy efficiency
and decrease our carbon emission levels. Using energy efficient lightbulbs, planting more trees,
adding rooftop solar panels, and starting a campaign to decrease food waste would all lessen the
negative impact we, as a university, are making on our climate. Thinking forward and on a bigger
scale, UVA should take the step to make all electricity use renewable whether that be through the
use of solar, wind, or hydropower. Currently, our buildings are heated by natural gas, coal, and
oil. These fossil fuels are what we must cut back on to achieve our overall goal of reducing
global warming. If we allocate 1.1% of the school’s budget, UVA will have 15 million dollars a
year to make these changes by 2050.
I believe that it is our duty as a public university to set an example for our government of
what must be done. This goal may seem far beyond reach, but we are amongst so many bright
minds from around the world. This is the place to aim high because we can then bring the
excellence that we achieve all around the globe to ensure a healthier environment.Read More",Student,Emma
community,"I was at the Community Conversation for ""Ours to Shape"" and you asked me what our shared vision for the future was after one of my responses and while I think I gave you a suitable answer, I think my answer failed to transmit the image in my mind. The answer is quite simple actually. Our shared vision is to live in a community that allows us to follow our passions, a community that has removed the obstacles that keep people from their dreams. A society that helps people discover, nurture and fol...low their passions because their skill, whatever it may be, is needed. Together we are so strong. However, strengths and skills just like any tool, can be used for both good and evil. By removing obstacles we allow people to show the better versions of themselves, supported by a community instead of being confined by it. Feeling love and gratitude instead of fear and resentment. We allow people to stand tall as themselves, to be respected and praised for their skills and contributions. Empower people to shine their light and success in all other areas of our community life (some of which I mentioned in my answer) will just be side effects of this individual empowerment because, as people become liberated from their own obstacles, their passions will in turn liberate others. Everything else will just fall into place.Read More",Staff,David
community,"It is my pleasure to write this letter of support for Roger Voisinet’s, Rick Ramsey’s, and others’ efforts to finally create a permanent home for the University of Virginia Hockey Teams as well as an outlet for Charlottesville and Albemarle ice skaters of all ages, shapes, and sizes – a UVA Ice Arena, something I feel a major university such as UVA should enjoy and benefit from multifold.

You might find it a bit strange that a former Drama professor and director is championing this ca...use.  I was UVA professor of Drama for 26 years, 1990-2016 and its chair for 15 or those years.  I also directed and produced plays and musicals for the Heritage Theatre, UVA’s summer professional theatre for 29 summers, 20 as its producing artistic director.  But I have always loved sports which I contend, as most Americans do, is another form of classic entertainment.  Having grown up in Detroit in the 1950’s, I found myself as a kid glued to our black and white TV on Saturday nights watching “Hockey Night in Canada” as “my” Detroit Red Wings often battled either the Toronto Maple Leafs or the Montreal Canadians.  I have carried this love of hockey with me ever since.

Since beginning my tenure at UVA, I have watched its enormous growth and the increased diversity of choices in many different areas for athletic participation.  I very was pleased when the downtown ice rink was constructed and was chagrined when it was recently closed.  Although my theatre schedule prevented me from attending many hockey games, I was aware of the team in the ACC Hockey League and considered it a real boon for the University and the community that student hockey players as well as local hockey fans were able to utilize this arena.  The fact that the downtown rink was also peopled by kids and families, whether playing hockey, figure skating, curling, or just SKATING provided Charlottesville with yet another facet that made it a great university town and gave our area a place for town and gown to meet on a regular basis.  I do believe that if you build a new ice arena -- they will continue to come.  As the “town” comes to JPJ and Scott Stadium so they will come to the Park.

As UVA has an exceptional intramural athletic program that allows our students to participate in so many different sports, the absence of being able to participate in sports on the ice is a huge void, especially since UVA has had such success over the years as champions in the ACCHL.  Mr. Jefferson felt the development and maintenance of physical fitness to be equal to the development of the mind and an ice rink will, I am certain, draw many of our students to use ice skating as one of their ways to keep physically fit.  Roger Voisinet and Rick Ramsey’s proposal for the UVA ICE PARK, if realized, will add yet another dimension to the way of life at UVA.  I hope you see it through to fruition and have a meeting with the Committee for Home Ice soon.

community,"As you may already be aware, autism spectrum disorder has become a pervasive and serious health and educational challenge in our local community, our state, and nationwide. Over 126,000 Virginians are currently impacted by autism and the CDC has now estimated that 1 in 59 children born in the United States will be diagnosed.  Researchers at the UVA Curry School of Education estimate that less than 50% of Virginians on the spectrum receive limited services - or any services at all.   There is not... yet a discovered “cause” or “cure” for autism; educational and therapy resources are severely limited for diagnosed children and their families; and for those young adults who “age out” of public resources at 22, their challenges of communication, behavior and isolation often leave them unemployed and a huge economic burden on their families and society. Although Charlottesville has been blessed with the private development of the Virginia Institute of Autism (VIA) -  an evidence-based treatment model school, outpatient program, and adult service academy – the need for these services, as well as autism research, teacher training, and medical diagnosis and management is growing at an alarming rate.

UVA has long been a partner with VIA in the important community work to service this special needs community.  Medical diagnosis, case management services and patient referrals from the Developmental Pediatrics Department of the School of Medicine have been ongoing for the past 20 years.  VIA has also been a practicum resource for teacher training in special education and speech therapy and a site for post-doctoral research for the Curry School of Education.  The Darden School iLab recently collaborated with VIA to begin development of micro-enterprises where adults with autism can experience the dignity and self-empowerment that comes with a paycheck. Moreover, one of the founders of VIA secured a grant for Telemedicine services in autism diagnosis and physician training for rural and underserved regions of Virginia. 

But I believe that, under your leadership, the time is right for a deeper collaboration between VIA, the University, the community of Charlottesville and beyond - and the development of a community-focused Autism Center of Excellence. This joint venture and state-of-the-art facility could bring together the expertise and interests of the various UVA Schools and Institutes now focusing on autism with the community partners providing service to this population, including VIA, the regional public school systems, employers across the Commonwealth, and the national autism advocacy and support organizations.  The Autism Center of Excellence could also provide a national model for exemplary and comprehensive integration of medical, educational, and therapeutic services for a lasting community benefit; as well as demonstrate UVA’s commitment to providing important and valuable research, teaching, training, and service opportunities for its faculty, students and staff.

Some of this work is already underway.  The UVA Board of Visitors recently provided Strategic Investment Fund support to the Curry School for faculty hires and dollars focused on groundbreaking research, evidence-based services and professional education and training.  New coursework in evidence-based Applied Behavior Analysis is now being offered by joint faculty instructors from Curry and VIA, with supervised practicum opportunities provided at all three VIA program locations.  The Developmental Pediatrics department of the UVA School of Medicine continues to provide diagnostic services for children with autism and referral to VIA’s School and Outpatient services, and is working to make this process more streamlined for families. At the new UVA Brain Institute, one of the nation’s top faculty in the autism field was recently recruited to accelerate both bench and applied research. 

Much work is being done, but the opportunity now exists for UVA and VIA to shape and build a community-based Autism Center of Excellence that adequately addresses this critical social need. VIA has a long wait-list of children, young adults and their families who desperately need the services, the research, the family support and continuity of care that a collaboration like this could provide. One of our goals at the Virginia Institute of Autism is to make Charlottesville and environs the most “autism-friendly” city in the nation … and with your leadership and support, we can make this happen!

community,"Two of my children attended UVA.  One also has a Masters degree and the other completed the pre med Post Bac program.  For both who wanted to stay on grounds their second year, having no on grounds housing available to them after first year impaired their sense of being a part of the community and thrust them into isolated apartment living.  Both found smaller communities -- a sorority and a Christian group-- but they missed interacting with a more diverse group of students that dorm living would have provided.  In my view, UVA has neglected this important aspect of care for students' physical needs  and  has missed an  opportunity to  build a stronger sense of community for undergraduates.","Parent, Community Member",Mary
community,"Student employment is an incredible opportunity for students to find community with other students and staff as well. Students have stated that this was more a source of community than an identity group on campus. However, some student employees in Newcomb are having that community striped away from them. This decision was made without their consultation, which is especially troubling since it affects them the most. It is also concerning since the supervisor has had such an incredible impact on his student's professional and personal lives. I am just hoping that from this situation we try to be more transparent with our students and the staff that directly serve them.",Staff,Jasmine
community,"I would like to weigh in on how the University can strengthen the sense of community within the greater Charlottesville region.

There are so many working parents in our community with special needs children, myself being one. We find it difficult to balance work with the extra care our children require. Most of these families have the Medicaid waiver for their children which allows them to hire personal care attendants and folks to provide respite for the caregivers. However, there is a very...large gap in finding these caregivers.  UVA’s student population abounds with those interested specifically in working with children and adults with disabilities as part of their academic and career pursuits. However, there is no coordinated information stream to get the word out to those students who are interested. I would love to see a University-wide initiative to bring together special needs families in the community and students who want to help. Off the top of my head, there are students in the Curry School special Ed program, Psychology's child psychology students, Nursing School, OT/ST students, medical students, and other students interested in working with people with disabilities. This experience would provide a two-way benefit: students provide the much needed paid support to special needs families and the student gains direct experience related to their studies.

I know this would work because I have been doing it myself for the last 3 years. I have worked hard to target the appropriate student populations within the University and developing contacts within those departments to help advertise my need for caregivers for my son while I am at work. Because of the issues related to his condition, I have chosen to home school him at this time. As a working single parent, this would seem impossible. But because I am able to hire 4-5 UVA students per week to cover my work schedule, I have been successful and my son has benefitted beyond what I can even describe. I still keep in touch with caregivers from years ago. He has developed many profound relationships with others that would not have been possible otherwise. The students have also expressed their gratitude for the impact my son has had on their pursuits and lives.  I will forever be grateful to the students at UVA who have helped me care for my son and allowed me to work to be able to financially provide the best life for him possible. I could not have done it without them. And there are SO many other families who are in my shoes and need this type of support. I am lucky to work at UVA and have the contacts I do. But this is not so for most families. Not only would I like to see UVA work directly with the special needs community, I would love to be a part of the effort. 

Related to this initiative would be working to create a friendlier workplace for families with special needs children. Often there is bias towards working parents of young children in the workplace, especially for those with special needs children. UVA could help by promoting a different attitude towards working moms, promoting the use of telecommuting and encouraging managers to be more flexible in allowing their employees to telecommute as needed instead of having to use precious leave time when they are at home with their child and able to work, providing UVA-hosted sensory-friendly events (drama performances, Easter egg hunts, Christmas parties, outdoor activities, etc.), and ensuring job security for special needs families when unexpected issues arise (reference the RAISE Family Caregivers Act of 2018). The life of a special needs family is more stressful overall and often isolated due to lack of opportunities, understanding, and support for themselves and their children. Add to that a sense that your job could be in jeopardy if your child is struggling and needs extra care and it can be unbearable at times. UVA offers so many great ways to support its employees but I see a gap in the area of family support, especially those families with special needs children. 

So many community needs could be met through the help of UVA’s employees, faculty, staff and students. How do we get everyone together?

Thank you for listening and please let me know if you have any questions or need further input. I’m happy to help in any way I can.

community,"Good evening, President Ryan.  My name is Ibby Roberts.  I teach bassoon and chamber music at UVA, and I also play principal bassoon and serve as Director of Youth Education for the Charlottesville Symphony at UVA.  I don't have specific suggestions of ways for us to improve students' sense of service, but I do want you to know about the youth education programs that I run in our community, for I believe they demonstrate acts of service already taking place.  UVA music performance faculty, stude...nts from a variety of fields of study, and community members, all of whom are members of the Charlottesville Symphony at UVA,  are the people who carry out the work that I organize.  We have seven main projects each year, and several other smaller programs.  There is some variety from year to year.  Over the last seventeen years the Charlottesville Symphony's youth education programs have served more than 107,000 children in public, private and home schools across eleven counties in central Virginia.  Our funding is almost entirely drawn from endowments within the Charlottesville Symphony Society, grants we apply for, and annual fund gifts.  The University of Virginia directly benefits from our work. People almost always assume we are ""UVA"" offering the services, even though the University actually doesn't fund the programs.  

Youth Concerts
Our biggest event of the year will occur this Thursday, October 18th, in Old Cabell Hall at 10AM and 11:30AM.  These are our annual youth concerts.  They are free for fourth and fifth graders throughout central Virginia.  Approximately 1650 students and chaperones attend the concerts each year; and we have a waiting list annually, too.   This year's theme is ""Jazzing up the Orchestra.""  School districts consider attendance at these concerts to be part of their curriculum.  Our goals are to excite kids about playing in their school music programs, to help them make educated decisions about the instruments they may choose to play, and to present music and musical concepts in child friendly ways so we plant the seeds of life-long learning about and listening to classical music.  If you are free this Thursday, October 18th, please stop by Old Cabell Hall Auditorium between 10AM and 10:45AM; or between 11:30AM and 12:15PM.  It's fine to just walk in and have a quick look/listen; or if you'd like me to set aside a seat for you or your staff members, please let me know and I will do that.  We have a few open seats at each concert.  It is a joyous way to spend a morning!

Virginia Film Festival Family Day Concert and Musical Instrument Petting Zoo
Six years ago we began partnering with the Virginia Film Festival's Family Day.  A chamber music ensemble comprised of faculty, student and community members of the Charlottesville Symphony offers an interactive concert at the start of the morning screening, introducing kids to our instruments and to themes from the films they will hear during the day.  Then we offer a musical instrument petting zoo mid-day between the two main films that are screened.  Kids and adults who are young at heart can try almost every instrument of the orchestra in the Helms Theater.  Both of these events are also free and open to the public.

Preludes School Visits
Professional members of the Charlottesville Symphony (who are also faculty at UVA) visit local schools, offering instrument demonstrations for elementary-aged kids, and master classes and coachings for middle and high school kids.  We make upwards of 80 free visits to schools throughout our region each year.  There are times when kids, who have seen us on these in-school visits, pick the instrument we play, study with us through middle and high school, and then come to UVA as students and play in the Charlottesville Symphony with us.  Through these visits we cover goals that individual teachers set for their students.  Usually individual musicians go into the schools, but we do occasionally send ensembles comprised of principal players of the orchestra.

Virginia Discovery Museum Meet the Symphony Musician
Twice each winter we serve younger kids, ages 2 through 7, through the VDM's Meet Me on Main Street series.  Professional members of the Cville Symphony (again who are faculty at UVA) demonstrate their instruments, accompany a story with music and sound effects while it is read, and run a musical instrument petting zoo in the family that their instrument is from.

Barrett Early Learning Center Tunes and Tales
Four times a year we offer similar programs at the Barrett Early Learning Center for their 2, 3 and 4 year olds.  Each visit covers a different instrument family of the orchestra (woodwinds brass, strings, percussion).  Again for these, professional members of the Cville Symphony demonstrate their instruments, accompany a story while it is read, and assist the kids in trying instruments from their instrument family.

James River Boys & Girls Club Violin Lesson Project
Several years ago the retired president of Virginia Tech offered to buy a set of violins for the kids at the JRB&GC.  The Club asked us to recommend what instruments they should buy.  We helped them pick the right instruments and accompanying materials - and we one-upped them!  We offered them a teacher for weekly lessons.  In addition to learning the violin, the 25 or so kids who participate each semester (Fall, Spring, Summer) also gain experience with self-control, public performance, basic musical skills, and the team aspects of music-making.  Sometimes we bring them to hear the Charlottesville Symphony, and sometimes we send members of the Symphony to perform for and with them in a side-by-side fashion.  The kids draw from Southern Albemarle, Fluvanna and Buckingham Counties.

Music For Hope Instrument Donations
We collect old and gently-used instruments, refurbish them as needed, and get them in the hands of needy kids and school programs in our region.  To date we have collected and placed more than fifty instruments.

Other Programs
Additional smaller programs through the years include:  a Pen Pal Project with Clark Elementary students who attended our Youth Concerts; an annual residency at Stuart Hall School in Staunton; additional programs (interactive concert and petting zoo) at the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind; Art Strings - Painted Violin Project at the Charlottesville City Schools that offer an early strings immersion program; Adopt-A-School at Red Hill Elementary (if funding comes through for this year); and the Eckford Free Tickets for Youth to attend Charlottesville Symphony concerts.

Returning to your ""Ours to Shape"" question, I do believe that the Charlottesville Symphony at UVA is well on its way, serving the community and involving students, faculty and community members in this process.  There are ways we could both expand and track the work we do, though, were we to partner with the Curry School, and were we to train students more to participate in different types of our programs than they currently do.  Frequently the students are maxed out with regards to time, though, so it is an area where we'd need to proceed cautiously.  We have always tried to maintain a high standard of quality for the services we offer, so we are careful about who serves in which ways.  Some of our projects are much better administered by professional musicians due to their level of training and experience as teachers.  That said, the door is always open for new projects.

If you have any questions about the Charlottesville Symphony at UVA's youth education projects, or if you or your staff would ever like to see any of our programs in action, I'd be happy to help arrange logistics.  In the meantime, if you do have even a few minutes free, please stop by Old Cabell Hall this Thursday during the time slots I mentioned above.

I wish you every success in you tenure here at UVA.  Welcome aboard!

community,"I think UVa students should be cared for more and better and have more of a priority. Right now, many things are catered to the Board of Visitors or prospective students or UVa basketball ticket purchasers.

5 Examples/Ideas:

1. Example and Ideas for basketball ticket purchasers being deemed more valuable then students after games: Students in Faulkner/Copeley basically have no way to enter Faulkner from 30 min to an hour after basketball games because the streets are closed off by police....This is unfair to students who pay to live in the space; students should be able to show ID to be let through to the Massie Rd section that leads to Faulkner/Copeley if safety is a concern. Not being able to go home makes one feel like an after thought.

2. Caring for students better: Laundry should be free. I know UVa can afford it (note: 2 Billion dollars in unallocated funds) and many other Virginia institutions do not charge their students for laundry. Maybe a weekly swipe policy could be used to combat overwashing/wasting energy and water. The swipes would solely be used to monitor wash/dry frequency; they would not cost students extra. If energy bills are deemed is an issue, I suggest UVa look into planting solar panels above the dorms. In the log run, this would prove a lot more cost effective though up front cost would be notable.

3. If there is anyway possible, there should be more parking on grounds for students, at least available for purchase. There are a decent amount of ""reserved to 5:00pm"" and ""reserved all times"" parking spaces that go unused because no faculty are assigned to them. These could be great parking spaces for people who sign up to carpool from 5 pm, and can be free to everyone else after.

4. This mixes UVa student experience and dining hall worker experience:
UVa needs to find a way to:

a. Make food better (learn from JMU and Virginia Tech models). Our dining hall food should definitely be of better quality and given more priority for betterment and competitiveness with other schools. UVa  would eventually benefit financially from this, also: about 90% of JMU undergrads have a meal plan, including non-freshmen. If we can approach that number via higher quality food, we will make more money as an institution.

b. UVa should have at least one dining hall still serving lunch from 2-5pm. The ""snack time"" hours are hard to cope with for engineering students and other students who will end a decent amount of clusters of classes after 1:50pm. If this requires a greater stagger between Newcomb and O'hill so that the workers can still receive adequate breaks, then that move should be made in my opinion. On that note, people who work UVa dining and facilities management should be treated better and have consistent and dedicated UVa outreach to show appreciation.

5. UVa faculty ethnicities should look more like its student body. I do not believe I have met a Latinx professor in the E-School and I have met one black professor. I know we can do better in this department, there are a large amount of qualified candidates, including our own graduates.

I hope this letter actually reaches decision makers. It comes from a student who wants to be able to graduate from a better UVa then he enrolled in; it comes from a student who want his siblings and all other prospective students to be able to enroll in a better, more student centered institution than he did. Student self-governance is great but caring for students from an administrative and financial standpoint is just as important.

When I was an undergraduate in the 1980s, there was a man who stood by the amphitheatre and read the Bible aloud. Looking back, I realize the courage that took in an environment that, even then, was not very receptive. In fact, I often looked forward to these kind of chance encounters with groups and ideas I did not know about. 
 
When we say ""we are unafraid,"" can we mean it? I understand protecting our students from torch-bearing marauders, that goes without saying, but I think this policy (PRM-017) could go too far. I am NOT afraid of someone standing on Grounds reading the Bible, the Koran, or the Torah or anything else. This is free speech delivered in a non-violent, even non-aggressive way. It might make me stop and ask a question, go research something, or maybe just realize there are people out there who are different from me. 
What about folks from the Catholic church handing out invitations to a Friday night cookout and sing-along? They will need a permit?
 
That is the power of UVa. We can be different and we can still work together to make the world better.

UVA could negotiate with Aramark, for example to increase pay to its employees; the increased costs of doing so would be paid for with increased dining costs. UVA would mitigate these increased dining costs for lower-income students through increased AccessUVA funding. 50% of the SIF distributions would still allow UVA's leaders to invest in projects, but would be a clear action to support equity.","Student, Staff, Alumna/us, Community Member",Katherine

I also think it reinforces gender stereotypes, e.g. men bring most of video game consoles, so women have fewer opportunities to join in if they don't live in those halls.

Turn the traditional model of seeking donations to a general annual fund to support financial aid and major gifts for endowed scholarships on its head – create a new platform to connect needy students directly to alumni (e.g., a GoFundMe model).  Create a database that allows alumni donors to search and find students with similar interests, passions, histories, and career trajectories, allowing dono...rs to become mentors to students as well.  By doing so you’ll allow for a stronger connection to the University and create lasting relationships between donors and students.  As all funds would be funneled through UVA to the student, the encouragement of more “micro” financial aid awards may also increase participation numbers and appeal to non-donors.

Our daughter began her first year at UVA on 24 August, and over the past two weeks, she has tried to join at least 8 different singing groups or choruses at UVA, and has been rejected and not been selected to join any of these. She is very disappointed and disheartened. She doing well with academics and new friends, but this deep disappointment is making her adjustment to college much more difficult.  After 4 years of high sc...hool chorus, singing has become a passion of our daughter, which she wants to continue for the next 4 years in the ‘UVA music community’.  If UVA earnestly wants to ‘build communities’, the community genuinely needs to include everyone who wants to be part of it. Our daughter was not singled out to be rejected as we understand that there were dozens of girls who auditioned who were also rejected. So there are many 1st year students who are not having the feeling of community that they had experienced during high school and had hoped to have by joining a singing organization on the UVA campus.  While we understand that these organizations have a certain number of students that they accept, those students who have experience singing in their high school choruses and audition for singing organizations at UVA should have an opportunity to continue this passion and growth experience during their college years. Perhaps there needs to be a 2nd-tier University Singers group who are able to be hospitable to all singers who have experience but did not make the highest-level University Singers group or other choruses. If you have students who have worked with their choral directors and sung in their high school choruses for 4-years, they should be able to continue their passion for singing and have a choral home at UVA.

community,"By now you must have received a number of these letters—from UVa alumni expressing their hopes and gratitude regarding the job ahead of you.
 
My day was a long time ago—graduating in 1961 when the University still handed out all diplomas on the Lawn and in 1959 when only the second transition of Presidents (Colgate Darden to Edgar Shannon) transpired. 
 
Much has changed at the University and much has not.  Academically, it was an era of “Gentlemen Cs”—rarely were As handed out. It wa...s an exceptional faculty then as it is now, although then members of the faculty were much more integrated into the life of the University beyond Cabell Hall and the other academic buildings. Many had studied as undergraduates at the University and, consequently, were well versed in its culture.  In my view, and many others, understanding the “culture” of the University is critical to carrying out one’s responsibilities as an administrator, at any level, on the Grounds.
 
I know you were both a law student and a highly regarded member of the law faculty at the University. Undoubtedly such experience gave you some insight into the “culture.”  Undoubtedly you have been fed firehose quantities of lore about the University by now, and once you take up the mantle formally you will get a whole lot more.
 
I have read Wait, What? and was impressed with your “five essential questions” and the bonus one as well.  Many alumni I know have taken the time to read the book. I have read about your interesting and impressive background and your many achievements so far.  I hesitate to note that I have not read about any involvement by yourself in undergraduate fraternity or social club life.  I do not see this as a drawback in any way, but in recent decades there has been an undercurrent among a number of college administrators that fraternities are detrimental.  Clearly, there have been some very unfortunate instances of gross misbehavior on the part of members of fraternities which cannot be ignored.  I would note that ill-conceived behavior among college students such as excessive drinking and sexual assault is not limited to fraternity members.  It is behavior that needs to be addressed and, I believe, such is the situation at the University.
 
I would hope that you have an open mind regarding fraternity life at the University and have heard about such from the University’s very capable Dean of Students, Allen Groves, who was well versed in fraternity life before assume his current role.  Fraternities have long been an important part of the culture at the University since before the Civil War.  They took hold at the University in the latter part of the 19th century.  There are about the same number of houses now as in my day.  Beside social activities, the houses engage in philanthropic and community activity and fraternity members serve as leaders in various aspects of University life.  I hasten to add, that scholarship achievement is important as well.  Many Jefferson and Echols scholars participate in Greek life. The fraternity all men’s academic average is usually higher than the all men’s average.  (Not sure these statistics are still being compiled.)
 
Another way in which fraternities and sororities serve University needs is by providing housing for a significant portion of students not living in University facilities. Also, most if not nearly all houses provide an affordable meal plan serving wholesome lunches and dinners.
 
Fraternities serve to develop bonds which continue among cohorts for life.  Importantly, a significant share of alumni financial support of the University comes from fraternity men and sorority women. This serves as an important reason for facilitating and securing a healthy Greek system at the University.
 
For sure during your tenure there will be instances of bad behavior attributed to one or more houses or members thereof which will need to be subject to appropriate remedial action. The Inter- Fraternity Council has emerged over the past decade or more as an effective body for dealing with disciplinary matters involve the houses and their members.
 
 I speak for myself and other alumni who have remained deeply involved with their fraternities at the University.  For my own involvement I have been in a leadership role for some 28 years and plan to stay with it!  Please do not hesitate to call on me if you feel I might be able to provide any counsel with respect to fraternity life at the University. 
 
I wish you the best as you move forward with your Presidency.

community,"I’m very heartened to hear about your commitment to community, discovery, and service, and as Director of the Academic Writing Program at UVA, I think you might find some of our recent initiatives interesting. Each of these is just getting off the ground, but I think they will eventually make a strong contribution to the goals you’ve identified.

First, we’ve begun to offer first-year writing courses that include community engagement. Last semester, one of these courses involved working at... a local food bank, while another had students explore “citizen science” initiatives that address climate change. While not every student has the time that such a course demands—students have the choice to take our standard writing course or one that includes community service—the students who’ve taken the service-inflected courses have responded with great enthusiasm and have given wonderful presentations on their work at the end of the term. We hope to expand the number of these writing courses in the years ahead.

Second, the Writing Program plans to propose a new undergraduate certificate in Public Writing and Rhetoric this year. The idea is for students in any major or school who would like to gain expertise in writing through additional coursework to pursue this 12-credit certificate. Based on my experience launching such a certificate at another institution, I believe many students across UVA will leap at the opportunity to become articulate writers who can address the public sphere, not just those in their discipline.

And finally, the Writing Program recently completed the hiring of three outstanding tenured colleagues, each of whom brings significant experience with community engagement. One of these colleagues (Prof. Stephen Parks) is the premier figure in writing studies nationally who teaches courses in which students and community members work together on a problem of local concern, and he has won over a million dollars in grants on behalf of community service projects. I look for these new faculty member to become key voices as we imagine what thoughtful community engagement might involve.

Thanks for inviting all of us at UVA to comment. I very much look forward to working with you.

community,"Friends, I'm a Virginia graduate, class of 1974 - the first year of our historic co-education, when UVA first began to forge the ways to truly make women feel welcome, as well as people of color. We faced quite a few cultural and climate struggles and felt saddled, in good measure, by our own legacy. 

As a gay young man among Virginia’s first year students as well as an Echols Scholar, I struggled silently in the closet that characterized the University in the early 1970s. It goes without say...ing that Virginia was little different from the rest of society in its understanding and accepting LGBTQ people.

UVa has come a long way, and yet has farther to go. I'm proud of the steps you have taken, yet I know there is more you can do to make Virginia a leader in engagement, support and leadership. I was one of the handful of leaders about a decade ago to meet with and to persuade then Governor Tim Kaine – with President John Casteen’s vocal support – to begin making health insurance benefits available for the first time to the life partners of LGBTQ faculty and staff. Regrettably after Governor Kaine’s term expired, Governor Bob McDonnell acted to stop it.

Under the inspiration and leadership of faculty like Charlotte Patterson and others (whose work I support financially), Virginia is making strikes in scholarship and expanded knowledge about LGBTQ issues for all students, and helping inspire a more welcoming community. The Serpentine Society, which I support, has also done a sizeable job growing LGBTQ alumni engagement.

Here’s what doing more could look like:

•	Additional resources to your existing LGBTQ scholarship investments, which can only inspire more matching generosity of Virginia alums and families.
•	President Ryan, senior University staff and the school itself ought to come “out of the closet” more and more frequently to express their welcome, support and understanding of their LGBTQ family – students, faculty, staff, alums, family members who care. I see this at other institutions, and not so often at Virginia.
•	While Virginia and other institutions are properly and belatedly honoring the enslaved people on the grounds who actually built Virginia, we might also consider ways to memorialize and speak to the past decades of homophobia for UVa LGBTQ people who fled the institution, took their lives, lost careers and futures when their identities became known. Why not work with archivists to research and find those stories, tell them and begin the healing and education about what homophobia cost earlier generations?
•	Focus as well on intersections among all University members – and remind the community that we come from families of color, different ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical and cognitive ability, and other ways to inspire and strengthen our mission. There is definitely common cause here, and it would be significant to know that LGBTQ people are part of this inspiration.

With hope and gratitude, my friends, and a warm welcome to our newest President Jim Ryan.

For many college campuses, this is a foregone conclusion, but not always in the South.  Fortunately for the past 23 years, the Ice Park on the Downtown Mall filled that void, albeit with a bit of a drive for students.  With the permanent closure of the rink this Spring, why not launch a rink on Grounds, accommodating ice skating, lessons and ice hockey.  UVa has sported a team for decades at the club level.  With a rink within our campus, more students would take advantage of that experience of cheering on their team or learning a new skill or simply recreating.",Alumna/us,Matt

This is obvious: Without Charlottesville's worker base, the University's residential and dining facilities could not operate; without its apartments or restaurants, the student experience would be severely handicapped; without Charlottesville's generosity in cases like Brandon Ave. and W. Main St., the University cannot grow.

So it stands to reason U.Va. should be treating Charlottesville and it residents like friends. Instead, the University bans them from protesting on Grounds, fails to pay them a living wage, and takes everything it can from the city — with nothing in return.

community,"I have three sons - two graduated from UVA and the youngest from W & L.  The youngest attended a small school because of our disappointment in the University's approach to guiding students.  Our oldest son was an Echols Scholar and even with that program received little direct guidance on course selection, majors etc.  Our middle son apparently failed to attend a single class for an entire semester and no one noticed.  This lack of guidance may be a large institution's approach but I believe it is the wrong one.  I think the advisor program should be strengthened with regular meetings scheduled and oversight provided.  We saw that in action at W & L and were favorably impressed.",Parent,Lynne
community,"""When I was young, my father told me I should find a way to be a “professional student,” because I so enjoy learning.  When joined UVA staff in Dec. 2012, I was very excited to become part of an academic community.  However, as an employee who works off-grounds, there is a disconnect.  I do not feel truly engaged with the University and many of the events are not readily available to off-site community members, due to physical and time constraints.  I try to attend some classes and FEAP semi...nars but since I don’t really know my way around grounds, and then finding a place to park, making my way to-from, carving out time in the workday (or afterward)… it can be challenging.  I would feel much more “included” if some UVA-sponsored programs made their way off-grounds.  As there are several outliers in the Pantops area, I would like to see some events/activities planned with us in mind.  
Suggestions:  A regularly -scheduled drop-in walk around the ponds by Kluge-Rue and Be Well, before/during/after work, open to any UVA folks who happen to be in the area; Maybe a lunch-time yoga session;  Personally, I avoid going on-grounds during the week because parking is such as hassle.  Could we make coming to grounds more accessible by offering use-it-or-lose-it once-a-month free parking @ one of the garages?  I never carry cash, and I rarely have extra in my account after payday.  I’d be much likely to make the trek to grounds for a seminar or event if I didn’t stress over parking; Early on I was told the Christmas party is really just for the physicians and residents, so I have not attended any of those events because I feel I would be unwelcome.  Now, after 5+ years, I would like to actually MEET some of my on-site colleagues.  How sad is it that I could literally bump into someone from my own department in the hall, and not know them!  Unfortunately, I’m not sure how to facilitate this.  Just having a “free parking” day might make it easier to get in and around and communicate face-to-face.""

community,"The university should move away from using Jefferson as it's primary brand. Yes, Jefferson is a part of the history and legacy, but 200 years later, does it make sense for this to be the primary representation of the university? As long as the marketing/branding of this university relies so heavily on Jeffersonian exceptionalism (which, I guess, is supposed to make the rest of us exceptional by association?), it will be impossible to apply a more critical lens to Jefferson's life and legacy. Yet... our nation is becoming increasingly diverse and our ability to remain a top institution of higher education will be reliant on our ability to recruit and enroll the best and the brightest from ALL backgrounds. We must acknowledge that Jefferson is not a symbol for diversity, inclusivity, and unity, and realize that continuing to employ his legacy as our primary asset is to our detriment. I came to this university because it has so many wonderful things to offer. I have amazing colleagues and incredibly bright, compassionate, and thoughtful students. The fact that Jefferson founded this university was not a selling point for me or for others with whom I have spoken about this issue. This is a reality our administration must contend with if it is serious about being a place where individuals from diverse backgrounds can feel welcomed and included.

community,"I think that the University and the community are a wonderful place. I recently moved here 2 years ago and am an employee of the University. I feel like I may add an outside looking in perspective. I think that we do a great job of putting students first. I think that we could use more support from the community. As a new employee moving from out of town it was extremely hard to find any housing options in the Charlottesville area. When I reached out to the university I was given little/no suppo...rt. Most universities have people/resources to help with this difficult transition. I am a single Male and my salary is $43,000 a year which is a decent salary for someone of my age. When searching for housing I was unable to find any housing in Charlottesville that was remotely affordable. Most places in the area rent is $1,500 a month not including any utilities. This is double what a normal person’s mortgage is. The real estate in the area is astronomical and there really is nothing around here. I come from a four seasons vacation area that includes a ski resort, a lake, and lots to do in and around the area all within 20 minutes. The cost of living there isn’t even comparable to here. Our most important staff is our bottom line and they make a salary that is potentially even less than mine and I wonder how they survive. I live in Waynesboro. My rent is half of what it would be in Charlottesville. I don’t spend any money in Charlottesville since I live in Waynesboro that’s where I do my shopping and dining out. So by driving up the cost of rent they have damaged the community because now I spend all my money in Waynesboro. The city of Charlottesville is missing out on that revenue.  This is a result of the housing bubble in 2007-2008. The wealthy in the area were able to snag up the majority of the foreclosures and other properties for dirt cheap. They now have a strangle on the housing market in the area which is driving up the cost of living in the surrounding areas. I think in order to grow we need support from the community. There is no reason that a STUDENT should be spending $1,000 a month to share a bedroom with someone else. Same with our staff. There are multiple people that have to take on second jobs in order to survive in this town. It’s insane because the only thing of true value in this area is the University. Without it this community dies. The hundreds of restaurants would crumble. The nice new apartments would go empty and the community would essentially fail. I don’t believe it is our job to support the community at this point. We do that every fall when 24,000 students show up to this area and spend money on food and in shops. It is time that the community supported us. Lower taxes in the city, increased housing options to help drive down the supply and demand of apartments, and better services to engage our students in other activities not alcohol driven.  Internally I think we work against ourselves. We make a lot of thing more difficult than they have to be. I understand safety and security and environmental health but there are times that all these entities work against one another and not together to formulate solutions. There is a bunch of different regulation out there. There is Federal, state county and city. We then add our own element that sometimes contracts and even federal regulations. This should all be very fluid and build off of one another and not inhibit progress. There is certain processes’ that are so difficult that you just avoid them for example hiring non-student employee for a part-time/ seasonal employment. To hire a student, it takes maybe a day or 2. For non-students it takes nearly 2 weeks to get them on payroll. This process should be streamlined and should be easy to maneuver so that those employees can get hired and then they can do the job they were hired to do.  Internally we even compete against ourselves. There are several different entities on ground that ultimately offer some of the same things for students to participate in. These sometimes overlap and actually compete against one another. We should be allocating these types events to the proper department and then running these events together as a University not as separate departments. We would get more buy in from the faculty/staff because there would potentially be more support and hopefully more student participation in return.  Another thing I have noticed is communication. When I first accepted my position through HR, they didn’t even notify my department that I had accepted the job. The week prior to my start date I had received a call from the department asking if I was still interest because they were about to bring the second candidate in if not. So I almost missed out on a job that I had already accepted because there was a lack of communication between my employer and HR. I would say things have changed on that end but they have not. My Girlfriend is a Nurse and is about to start working at the hospital. She accepted her position at the end of June. For the past month she had been trying to figure out what all she needed to start her employment. She starts August 13th and less than 2 weeks out she was sent an email stating she had to have xyz completed before her first day. This included 3 different classes and other trainings that needed to be complete within a week. They didn’t provide any information of how to enroll or even what some of them were for. When she spoke to her manager she was told she only needed to take 1 class and that she should have received this information a long time ago. This has left her scrambling over the past week to get everything in order for her job on Monday when she had an entire month of nothing going on between school and employment. Communication is key and I think that it is something we lack especially to people who are newly hired.  Our student staff are under paid. There are many jobs on grounds that are also available in the community. The community entities have the upper edge because they pay their staff a higher wage then we do. I wouldn’t work for someone who paid me 2 or 3 dollars less an hour. So we now have to compete to staff our own buildings with private investors who are profiting from the fact that the University is here. There is also this separation in wages amongst ourselves. There is a lot of money that goes to the people at the top while the people at the bottom do a lot of work with little return. I think we could do a much better job of supporting our bottom-line staff so they can thrive in this community like everyone else. When the majority of our students are living better than our staff that becomes a degrading and off-putting. (this could be self-inflicted in some cases) One major change is that we need Self leadership followed by peer Leadership. People that are leaders because they are self-guided and in turn are followed by their fellow peers. In the world today there are way too many designated leaders. People placed in a position because they have a degree of higher education. Some of the best leaders are those who have worked their way from the bottom up and know what it is like to do the job at the bottom-line and actually know how to support them and didn’t learn it from taking a class in college. Our best department is our facilities management. We have the 2nd largest University facilities team in the country and they are very efficient and very good at what they do. they train their staff through apprenticeships. These apprentices grow in to trades which then grow in to supervisors. They are well seasoned and understand how the bottom-line works because they were in the trenches once themselves. Experiential learning develops strong knowledge which then translates in to strong leadership.  I would love to sit down and have dialogue with yourself or anyone to bounce ideas, thoughts, and concerns off of in order to help better shape the Students and Faculty/Staff. These are the most important resources we have. Without Students and Faculty there is no University. With no University there is no Community.

We are so insular here & often seen as elitist.  But there is nothing that prevents us from a more national reach and much in the way of technology that would allow our voices to be heard by many more than local residents. Each AV conversation by Podcast/Tweet/Facebook Post could be much like most of Sabato’s posts not a partisan direction but simply an educational expression. By being nationally engaged we broaden our reputation, give knowledge for the sake of learning, & tempt many to our doors not just for a formal education but for community building, pride of place, a bulwark against complacency and apathy.

community,"Community is ultimately spiritual, because community requires sacrifice, including prestige, career, and power, to help those in need, to the glory of God; and the community has to be worthy of that sacrifice. Violence is the antithesis of sacrifice, and results in destruction and isolation. So, the university needs to separate itself as much as possible from organizations that rely on violence for any reason, such as survival, power, and prestige. Unfortunately most of UVa's grants come from su...ch organizations, and those grants undermine the community partly because they require resources that prevent the sacrifice needed to build community, and partly because they direct the results of research toward further violence. Until those who lead UVa place higher priority on community than those grants, UVa will not have a sense of community. UVa at least needs to avoid punishing those who witness againts violence, no matter the justification for the violence, whether it be for security, research, education, health care, poverty assistance, or anti-hate. As long as UVa is under heavy influence of organizations that rely on violence, UVa needs to cooperate with the leadership provided by the churches, houses of worship, and civic organizations that maintain a core principle of nonviolence, and hope that they have the spiritual guidance to inspire the sacrifice that creates community. Without compulsion, the leadership of UVa would do well to set individual examples of supporting such organizations.

UVa is far enough away from major job markets that computer folk here made way less than people made in Richmond or Mana...ssas Va.  This gave UVa the feel of being a plantation.  I hope these old ways continue to change.  My retirement is based partially on the 3-4 salary freezes that the state applied to classified staff in the last 15 years.  State funding at UVa is 9-15% but 100% of my salary was frozen.  I also say that UVa was very wise. They paid us poor salaries so we learned to get by on less.  This certainly makes retirement easy!!

But the stacks of Alderman (and the other UVA libraries) remain one of the most exciting places on Grounds for the UVA and local community and an essential research facility for faculty, graduate students, and specialized staff members working in the humanities. More than that: the Alderman collection is a host of minds...and voices who are also part of the UVA community.  Moving a substantial proportion of that collection to closed stacks on Old Ivy Road and storing these books by size rather than cataloging order will render them permanently unbrowsable and discoverable only through VIRGO.  This in turn places new obstacles of time and inconvenience in the path of those—UVA and non-UVA people—trying to do high-level work in the humanities. Instead of going to Alderman and quickly checking to see what holdings actually deal with a point of interest, each book will have to be called, pulled, and transported to Grounds on the chance that it might be of use. Discovery is suppressed by closed stacks.  And the voices contained in those books are effectively silenced. Plans for the renovated Alderman are now far advanced, but whatever can be done to continue to house the Alderman collection (including bound periodicals) on Grounds will be a service to everyone who needs ready access to a first-rate research collection rather than a curated selection from the collection.

discovery,"One of the biggest threats that is currently being faced by our world is Climate Change and Global warming. This is a problem that will certainly cause catastrophic destruction in the future in the form of human suffering, extinction, migration and conflict. The threat is imminent and the danger is real. It has been tested again and again, it is proven. The time to test it is now over and it is now time for real action to address this issue. The goal that we need to aspire to achieve is one that... limits warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Each individual and every organization has a role to play in this. As such The University of Virginia, an institution that prides itself on educating the next generation of leaders around the world, has a part as well. As a University community, we need to set concrete and specific goals for our community that will reduce emissions and limit warming. We can begin with food waste. I have personally noticed a great amount of food being wasted at our various dining facilities around grounds. Programs that educate students and faculty on this waste and its impact need to be implemented and the quantities of food prepared needs to be re-evaluated. Next, we can make a difference by starting a planting initiative where we go to various areas around our University and plant trees that would help take carbon out of the atmosphere. Moving on to energy, we need to start investing more on renewable energy sources to power the University buildings, this could be anything from Solar to Nuclear. This is one that will be difficult but is crucial and programs need to be established that help address this problem. In terms of transportation, UVA needs to aim to make all UVA vehicles be powered with electric or other clean, renewable sources of energy. Again, this is no easy feat and will be expensive but it is definitely worth taking a hard look at. Finally, we need to do what UVA is best known for, educate. I think that it should be a requirement for every single student who attends UVA to take a class on climate change (EVSC 1450 taught by Deborah Lawrence is a great option). This will allow the next generations of students to be not only be aware of this imminent danger but also be equipped with knowledge on how they can personally go about addressing it. From reducing emissions in their personal homes and businesses to voting for public figures who will enact meaningful regulations such as a Carbon Tax, this knowledge will go a long way to help the future leaders work to mitigate this tremendous issue.

discovery,"As a student taking EVSC 1450 (Climate, you, and CO2) at UVA, I care deeply about
climate change and what we can do as individuals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A goal I
have for the next four years is to spread my vision for necessary climate action at around
grounds. Through writing to you, I wanted to express how important it is for us as a community
to pledge to prevent future commitment to warming. If we follow policies already in place, we
will end up with global warming of abou...t 6℉, which may not sound like a lot, but it really is. In
the last century in Charlottesville, we used to have 5 days of extreme heat per year. Now, with
the 1℃ of warming we have already committed to, we are already up to 10 or 15 such days. At
this rate by 2050, we could have close to 39 deadly heat days per year. Recent work by the IPCC
shows just how dangerous our commitment to 2℃ is, so we our best plan is trying to limit
warming to 1.5℃, instead of 2℃. As a result, we need to work hard by quickly switching to
renewable energy because even though if we achieve the goal of the Paris agreement it will still
be hot, it will be better.
As a first year student living in dorms I have seen a few ways in which we can contribute
in doing our part to help prevent drastic warming. I would like to start, however, by saying that I
felt the energy competition was a good start. Living in a hall, I saw how many of us made more
conscientious efforts in reducing energy consumption. For example, we would turn our lights off
in the bathrooms, use less water, and turn off our fans if we were leaving our rooms. As a result,
I would recommend continuing this each year and maybe encouraging it to be done again second
semester.
One thing that I have seen when I have been walking back to my room at night is that all
of the lights are left on in the old dorms that are being renovated. If possible, I recommend that
less lights are left or all are left off. This wastes a lot of unnecessary energy that leads to an
increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. My last recommendation I have for becoming a more energy
efficient school deals with the newly renovated dorms. These dorms have tvs in their halls in
front of their elevators. When visiting my friend, I have noticed that they are always on. Since it
does convey important announcements I can understand why they might be on, but a start is to at
least have them turned off at night and a couple hours during the day.
Of course, there are many other ways to become energy efficient around grounds, those
are my top suggestions, all in which are fairly easy to solve. As a community, we all have the
capacity to do something in reducing warming in our future. If we all pull together and do our
parts, I feel that we can foster a culture in our community of shared responsibility. While efforts
may require some investment, such as, using efficient light bulbs and efficient appliances there
are some ways that cost nothing. These include: avoiding food waste, serving less red meat in the
dining halls (because of methane), and encouraging walking instead of relying on the buses.
Overall, our small actions have big consequences so it is up to us to start pulling our parts
because it will be cheaper to solve these problems now then it will be in the future.Read More",Student,Virginia

the academics that made me fall in love with UVA, but also the community that it is surrounded
by. Every student, faculty, and staff of this is the school is so lucky to be in a place that supports
change and action when needed; therefore, UVa is the perfect leader to address climate change in
our community. With a goal of 1.5℃, there is a lot that needs to be done, and quickly. The first
step shou...ld be getting involved. The Climate Leadership Network, which is run by Second
Nature, is a network of colleges and universities in all 50 states who have committed to take
action on climate and prepare students to face challenges in the 21st century. By joining this
network, the university would be agreeing to a Climate Action Plan, which could be created by
students to ensure involvement from the whole community. This action plan could include
replacing all inefficient lighting, creating a set temperature point for buildings, or increasing the
number of occupancy sensors in bathrooms and similar varied occupancy rooms. We are lucky to
be in an area of the country where most people feel obligated to makes changes to protect the
planet. UVA would not be alone in our fight for the environment. The above mentioned steps,
however, may not be enough to help reduce the impact of climate change. But with additional
changes such as looking into more energy efficient vending machines, exploring solar thermal,
and switching to energy storage techniques so that we use energy when it is less expensive. UVA
has already come along way with the increasing number of recycling bins and emphasis on
sustainability. It is easy to see that students care about the environment, but we need the
community as a whole to be involved in order to make the greatest change. Knowing of
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, doing annual and long-term reports, and continuing to
share the importance of understanding the implications of climate change, UVA can help shape
the community. A model for UVA should be Harvard, with which you have special ties. They
have set goals such as being fossil fuel free by 2050, reducing waste by 50% by 2020, and
reducing water use by 30% by 2020. Simply setting a timeline, that is achievable, we would be
taking a step in the right direction. With the help of students and skilled, intelligent professors in
all departments, UVA can set goals to acheive. Starting is always the hardest part. However,
there are hundreds of members of the UVA and Charlottesville community who are willing to
put in the necessary work to help save our planet. Boston University plans to be net 0 by 2050,
WashU wants to reduce its emissions to the 1990 amount, and Colorado Boulder wants to reduce
emissions 80% by 2050. These examples show that people are making changes and if we do not
join them we are hurting everyone. It is no longer about us, it is about the future generations who
will be affected by everything we do today. Instead of having to explain in 50 years how UVA
has adapted to climate change, let’s start explaining now how we are taking steps towards a

The UVA Health System and the Schools of Medicine and Nursing are recognized as world-class leaders in training pre- and post-licensure nursing and medical professionals, advancing health sciences and medical research, and delivering knowledgeable, compassionate, quality health care, all of which reflect the core university mission of excellence in teaching, research, and service. 

T...hen there is Lola’s Song, emanating from an all too familiar story of miscommunications, misdiagnoses, and medical errors, all resulting in an infant daughter dying in her mother’s arms.  It is a globally occurring story which can be translated La Cancion de Lola, La Chanson de Lola, Canção de Lola, and ローラの歌.  Lola became one of 200,000 estimated preventable hospital-related deaths occurring each year in the United States, making this the 3rd largest cause of death behind heart disease and cancer.  This is equivalent to a 61,500 Scott Stadium capacity crowd attending the 2018 opener dwindling to one quarter capacity 83 days later at seasons end. 

Lola’s parents wrote the Lola’s Song Pledge to honor their daughter, raise awareness of preventable hospital-related deaths, and inspire health professionals to provide the best care for every patient every day.  Most entering the health professions intuitively desire to fulfill this pledge, only to encounter barriers that thwart their best efforts.  Healthcare professionals often lack skills in effective teamwork and have limited time and resources to build teams and trust.  Hierarchies and cultures clash within healthcare teams, impacting team effectiveness. These barriers provide fertile soil for medical errors and preventable hospital-related deaths which adversely affect patients, families, and healthcare providers.  In alarming numbers health professionals are burning out, leaving their professions, lacking engagement, and committing suicide at higher than national averages.

How do healthcare professionals overcome these barriers to effective teamwork?  How do they move from intuitive to instinctive to intentional interprofessional teamwork behaviors which can reduce preventable hospital-related deaths?  How do they educate and train pre- and post-licensure nursing and medical professionals to do the same? How do they address the adverse repercussions of medical errors on patients, families, themselves, and those in training?  How can the answers to these questions foster the UVA mission of strengthening community, discovering new knowledge through research, and promoting service to the Commonwealth and beyond?

It is recognized that the delivery of enhanced health care services and improved patient outcomes are linked with interprofessional healthcare teams whose members have been trained to practice collaboratively. It also is recognized that interprofessional education is an approach to promote collaborative practice competencies and practice skills, thus improving the safety and quality of care in U.S. health care delivery systems.  

Interprofessional education occurs “when two or more professions learn about, from, and with each other to enable effective collaboration and improve health outcomes.”  Collaborative practice “happens when multiple health workers from different professional backgrounds work together with patients, families, care givers, and communities to deliver the highest quality of care.”

Research has provided growing evidence of the positive impact of interprofessional education and collaborative practice on learners’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes and practice behaviors, but generalizable inferences are difficult to make from these study results.  Additional research is needed to provide evidence-based answers to the questions posed above.  This research would consist of outcome studies explicitly linking interprofessional education and collaborative practice interventions to improving population health, reducing health care costs, and promoting effective interprofessional teamwork.  These outcome studies could be conducted by interdisciplinary teams collaborating across colleges and departments.  

Let’s dream, aspire, and believe that the University can impact the Commonwealth, nation, and society at large by discovering the answers to these questions.  In so doing, we fulfill our purpose as a public university and strengthen and serve the world community for generations to come.

discovery,"I feel that the University should follow the lead of the University’s founder, Thomas Jefferson, in a new way – not by looking into and holding onto the past that has been given to us, but instead to follow his lead in the method of how he designed and structured both the university as well as his family home, Monticello. Instead of focusing on living in the past – history and focus on the old world (Europe), Jefferson worked to bring a strategic blend of the two: i) knowledge, appreciatio...n and inspiration from the best parts of Europe and elsewhere as well as ii) placing a significant focus on discovery, new developments, and the future, with the overall goal being the betterment of individuals and society as a whole.
At its founding, UVA was created to be like no other existing university – an architecturally beautiful grounds in which was housed a community of faculty and students living, working and learning together in an experiential way surrounded by artifacts of the past and present while striving to envision the future world of tomorrow in all its manifold ways.
How does this apply to moving UVA forward into its third century? Taking Jefferson’s beloved Monticello as an example might be a good place to start. Although it was a beautiful and gracious family home, Monticello was also an industrial enterprise. And in designing and organizing the structure of the property, Jefferson used the best inspiration from the past – European architecture, and combined it with practical, forward looking concepts of the future via: i) his use of a polygraph to make duplicates of all of his correspondence; ii) the unique space-saving design of his bed; iii) his 7-day clock; iv) his unique insulative wall design which helped keep the interior of the house cool even during the hot summer months; v) his methods of storing ice year round; vi) his experimental methods of horticulture in the fields around Monticello; and so many more.
By using Monticello as an example, UVA should work to envision the transformation of the University Grounds into a Model of the future, which would also couple as a Living Lab tied to the education and research of the student population. Students and faculty would be able to live, work and learn in an inspirational environment, which would be a beautiful blend of architectural excellence (both classical and modern) and vibrant futuristic functionality. Practical examples of this could be: i) Beautiful and functional Zero Energy Buildings all around Grounds; ii) a hybrid and/or all-electric bus transportation system; iii) an innovative, cost-effective, efficient and personal health care system that serves the entire local community in an extremely personal and caring manor; iv) an on-grounds fully functional combined heat and power (CHP) system providing all of the facilities’ power and heating/cooling needs in an ultra-efficient, energy conscious and environmentally sustainable manor.
If envisioned, planned and executed properly, UVA could grow to be seen as a beacon on a hill of the way forward to the practical, sustainable future that we all aspire to – an example of what every place could be in the future, what others could strive to emulate as well as a test bed for further advancements which would enable continual progress of this vision into the future.Read More",Faculty,Roger
discovery,"Thank for you opening this open forum to offer thoughts about the University’s future. I want to take the opportunity to offer two proposals that are more radical than those I’ve seen quoted on the Ours to Shape webpage, but that I think deserve articulating as ways of imagining the University’s shape in a future that we already can predict will be very different from the past. And, too, I want to move the Overton window of the possible to encompass ideas that in all probability will in 50... years look like obvious things to have done. The University of Virginia should take the lead among public universities in banning varsity football and eliminating the Greek system.

Football. If we really do believe in scientific peer reviewed knowledge, we cannot continue to sponsor as entertainment a sport where the athletes are, science is making clear, subjected to a high risk of irreparable brain damage. Within a decade or less it will be possible for doctors to discover such damage in real time, and they are also very probably going to discover significant damage at lower levels of violence than we now do. College and even high school players will be shown to be running extremely high risks of significant brain damage. The odds are that parents will increasingly (as many are already) refuse to allow their sons to participate in a such a game as it becomes clear that many college football players are suffering from some of the effects of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. I know that students sign waivers, but brain science is also making clear that people are typically unable accurately to assess their personal risk until at least their mid-20s; the legal structure of liability lags behind brain science, but that does not invalidate the science or permit us to claim ignorance of it. I also know that researchers in bioengineering at UVa are trying, with the support of corporations that equip athletes and the NFL itself, to devise helmets that are safe. My belief is that this is a temporizing effort to forestall the inevitable. UVa can take leadership by moving now to what will be clear in a couple of decades; football, like boxing (at one time an enormously popular sport both at the University of Virginia and nationally), cannot be made neurologically safe, and colleges that aim to educate rather than to traumatize young brains have no business being a party to it. And I say this as a fan of baseball, basketball, soccer, swimming, and other sports, all of which carry risks of their own. I’m not opposed to university-level sports, but believe that it is time for people who continue to believe in science to draw some lines.

The Greek system: Leading private colleges and universities are already moving away from the Greek system, seeing it as institutionalizing the very kinds of inequality and exclusivity that the University is otherwise spending so much time and effort trying to work against. Sooner or later, a leading public university will follow Williams, Amherst, and (perhaps) Harvard in banning the Greek system in favor of other kinds of undergraduate residential experience. (Wesleyan has, as you probably know, adopted the interesting experiment of forcing the Greek system to be co-ed, thus taking away part of its whole reason for being, and likely putting it into a long-term death spiral; this is an example to be watched.) To be sure, banning the Greek system will not solve the problems of inequality, inclusivity, and alcohol-fuel sexual violence that have become too big a part of its culture for the system to serve the higher aspirations of its original purposes any longer. These problems exist in the larger society and will take more than colleges and universities banning fraternities and sororities to eliminate. But the institutions that have banned the Greek system have never looked back and now see it as fundamental to their identity and to their pursuit of excellence. The University of Virginia can, and should take the lead among public universities in ending a Greek system that on balance does more harm than it does good.

Believe me when I say that I know that I am tilting at windmills on both fronts, and that both football and the Greek system have strong support in the student body, the alumni, the Board of Visitors, the state legislature. Nor would I fault current administrators for reserving their political capital for goals that seemed more achievable. But neither of these institutions was present at the University’s founding; their histories are briefer and more contingent than we might think, and their roots are shallower than they appear. What is more, neither is likely to be part of UVa's long-term future in a globalized world if it wishes to be more than a provincial institution. Outside the U.S., the leading global universities are generally unburdened by the legacies of 19th century fraternal organizations and 20th century televised violent sport. If UVa wants to join the ranks of those universities in the decades ahead, it should cut itself loose from the costs—economic, moral, and social—of those legacies. And, too, history is filled with people who believed that change on this scale was unimaginable but who were quickly surprised by the rapidity of change around them. My guess is that 50 years from now, and quite possibly much sooner than that, both football and the Greek system will be gone from most US universities, that the change will have come surprisingly quickly, and that the institutions that took the lead and anticipated rather than reacted to those changes will be enormous beneficiaries of their foresight as well as being understood to have been on the right side of history. 

Thanks for providing this opportunity. As I saw, my goal is here largely to enter into discourse things that are not, to my knowledge, currently in the air, but that will probably come to seem obvious, inevitable. All best wishes as you attempt to bring together all of the input you have gathered.

discovery,"I’m an associate editor at the Papers of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. Along with our sister project at Princeton University, we publish all letters written and received by Jefferson. Here at Monticello, we publish the documents from the period after Jefferson’s retirement from the presidency, covering the years 1809 to 1826. As you are aware, this covers the time period when Jefferson is actively involved in founding the University of Virginia. So not only is our project the definitive do...cumentary source on Jefferson, it will also be a vital source of primary materials on the establishment of the University.  I write to you today because I am very concerned about the plans for the redesign of Alderman Library. Our staff of ten is very fortunate to be community borrowers of the University of Virginia Library system. We could not do the work that we do without access to a high-quality and wide-ranging research collection like that at Alderman. Jefferson’s correspondence covers topics as diverse as architecture, agriculture, slavery, education, books, wine, politics, and the current events of his time. As such, we frequently need to research and explain references for the sake of modern readers. It is vital for us to have easy access to a large, browseable collection of books and other print materials. We are extremely concerned that the plans for the redesign of Alderman Library dramatically lower the number of books available and browseable on grounds.  Because we are not a University-based project, we rely on being able to come to grounds and access as many books as possible at once in order to be efficient. Our staff tends to arrive at Alderman with a list of books and microfilm that we intend to consult, but our on-site research often points us to other works that we were unaware of. If a high proportion of books and print materials are moved to Ivy Stacks, this process will be much less efficient, as it will force us to make multiple trips to grounds as works are retrieved for us. The nature of our work means that we are constantly under a series of publication deadlines, so it is very helpful for us to be able to immediately put our hands on the materials we need as research queries arise.  I am well aware of the usefulness of digital research materials; I have been with the Jefferson Papers for over thirteen years and the expansion of digital resources in this time has been amazing. We still find however, that there are many books, journals, and microfilm that we can only access at Alderman. I welcome many of the changes intended for Alderman, especially that of increased accessibility of materials for all patrons. But I think it is short-sighted to redesign the main research library at the flagship state university so that has LOWER capacity for print materials rather than planning for future growth of collections on grounds where they can be accessible to researchers.  I thank you for your consideration of this, and for the consideration of the Board of Visitors to whom I will also be addressing my comments. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the circulation staff at Alderman Library and the staff of Small Special Collections Library, all of whom are exceedingly knowledgeable and helpful. For thirteen years I have found it a joy to do research at the University of Virginia; I hope that the University will continue to support this experience by promoting a large and browseable collection of materials on grounds.

discovery,"Mr. Jefferson’s focus is on “useful knowledge”.  Today, I feel too many of our students (probably faculty as well) are lacking in the knowledge and skills relating to 1) cultural awareness, 2) inclusive decision-making, and 3) teamwork. These three attributes driving to personal emulation and action are critical for citizens today and tomorrow if America and UVA is to make progress.  These characteristics also just happen to be exemplified by the Corps of Discovery of the Lewis and Clark E...xpedition including the actions of the native peoples who in a somewhat convoluted way were also Americans at that point in light of the Louisiana Purchase.  Both groups were engaged in discovery of one another.  The spirit of teamwork, inclusive decision-making and cultural awareness shown by all those involved resulted in a successful expedition to the Pacific Ocean and back. All of this occurred on Thomas Jefferson’s watch as President of the United States.  Which gets me to my suggestion for ‘entering the future’ from this initiative.  I propose a set of 1 credit capstone “Bicentennial Seminars” that would focus on set of differing yet critical issues looking forward to be developed by faculty known for excellence in teaching.  For the next decade as part of the Bicentennial Celebrations, I would require all UVA students to take at least 2 of these courses.  One course I would develop myself, were I still a University Professor here as I once was, would be entitled, “Health and Human Values”.  The course would survey key dimensions relating to values surrounding health; as such it would focus on three sets of personal values important to citizens of a republic.  These include personal, professional and civic values.  Part of the course requirements would be having the learners make a template of their current values both as they express them verbally and as they see themselves actually living them out today.  Then this exercise would require them to create target goals for each personal, professional, and civic dimension of their lives for five years into their future and projecting forward for 20 years into their futures.   Of course, there are no correct answers for grading each on their exercises except for the attentiveness they seem to have brought to the exercise.  They would be encouraged to put this list in a place where is it is accessible to them so that they would review it at least every five year.  Among the lectures and discussion in this particular 1 credit course would be a review of the current knowledge on content and skills relating to:  1) cultural awareness which would not only relate to issues such as diversity and inclusivity but also practical skills exemplified by living experts such as the Dalai Lama, 2) inclusive decision-making including the science base on how to utilize processes to assure this end, and 3) teamwork which involves not only leadership but also followership.  Teamplay is also worthy of discussion since at its highest manifestation, teamwork morphs into ‘teamplay’.  What are the ‘pillars’ of successful teamwork?  Coach Tony Bennett would be one ideal lecturer on this topic with a focus on his leadership pillars of humility, passion, servanthood, unity, and thankfulness.Read More",Staff,Jessica

I loved my time at UVa, recognize what a truly special experience those 4 years were and how lucky I am to have had them. However, I would have greatly, hugely benefited from some direction and preparation for life after graduation. From my friends who were in the Engineering, Architecture, Nursing and Comm Schools, I know that they were much more prepared than I was to be successful when they graduated. They had jobs, they... had interviews, they had direction. I had none of those things. I realize that those schools are specialized and the College is not. I know that there were resources available to me if I had sought them out. But I, and a number of my friends, graduated and our first few jobs after graduating were jobs we could have gotten without a high school degree. I recently had a conversation with a good friend about this, and he essentially said that the situation hasn't changed. I'm not criticizing UVa for this, but I am advocating that students in the College receive some direction, whether they know what they want to do when they graduate or not. Someone who talks to them once or twice about resources available to them, things they could be doing to prepare, etc. No one talked to me about any of these things while I was at UVa.

discovery,"The first step to new knowledge is prioritizing instruction over grants. Isaac Newton said, ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."" To achieve new knowledge, students first need the opportunity to learn knowledge that has already been attained, as judged by professors, and confirmed by alumni. Too many faculty are pushed out of that job by the ""publish or perish"" priorities of the grant mill, and it lands in the laps of graduate students who often have limited know...ledge and cannot communicate what they do know. Other faculty entrench themselves through academic politics, even though their knowledge is irrelevant to the economic success of graduates. So, the second step to new knowledge would be giving successful alumni some say in academic promotion and tenure. Each department should have a fundry, where seats are auctioned off to its alumni for one year terms. The fundry will recommend hiring, promotion, and tenure, and have a veto on those events. The seats in the fundry provide tangible recognition to significant donations, and the money raised would make up for any lost grants. Furthermore, the fundry provides direct connections to outside organizations generating knowledge, and people working there.
